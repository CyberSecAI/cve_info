    "description": "The TLS implementation in EMC RSA BSAFE-Java Toolkits (aka Share for Java) supports the Extended Random extension during use of the Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain plaintext from TLS sessions by requesting long nonces from a server, a different issue than CVE-2007-6755.",
