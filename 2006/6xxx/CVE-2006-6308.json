  "description": "Symantec LiveState 7.1 Agent for Windows allows local users to gain privileges by stopping the shstart.exe process and open Web Self-Service from the system tray icon, which will open a browser window running with elevated privileges. NOTE several third-party researchers have noted that administrator privileges may be necessary to terminate shstart.exe. If this is the case, then no privilege escalation occurs, and this is not a vulnerability",
