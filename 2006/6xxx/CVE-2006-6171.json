    "description": "ProFTPD 1.3.0a and earlier does not properly set the buffer size limit when CommandBufferSize is specified in the configuration file, which leads to an off-by-two buffer underflow. NOTE in November 2006, the role of CommandBufferSize was originally associated with CVE-2006-5815, but this was an error stemming from a vague initial disclosure. NOTE ProFTPD developers dispute this issue, saying that the relevant memory location is overwritten by assignment before further use within the affected function, so this is not a vulnerability",
