    "description": "Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 does not properly handle Drag and Drop events, which allows remote user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a link to an SMB file share with a filename that contains encoded ..\\ (%2e%2e%5c) sequences and whose extension contains the CLSID Key identifier for HTML Applications (HTA), aka Folder GUID Code Execution Vulnerability. NOTE directory traversal sequences were used in the original exploit, although their role is not clear.",
