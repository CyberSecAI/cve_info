    "description": "The server driver (srv.sys) in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, 2000, XP, and Server 2003 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via an SMB_COM_TRANSACTION SMB message that contains a string without null character termination, which leads to a NULL dereference in the ExecuteTransaction function, possibly related to an SMB PIPE, aka the Mailslot DOS vulnerability. NOTE the name Mailslot DOS was derived from incomplete initial research the vulnerability is not associated with a mailslot.",
