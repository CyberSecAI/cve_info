  "description": "Buffer overflow in the DNS Client service in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP1 and SP2, and Server 2003 SP1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted record response. NOTE while MS06-041 implies that there is a single issue, there are multiple vectors, and likely multiple vulnerabilities, related to (1) a heap-based buffer overflow in a DNS server response to the client, (2) a DNS server response with malformed ATMA records, and (3) a length miscalculation in TXT, HINFO, X25, and ISDN records.",
