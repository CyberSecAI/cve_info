    "description": "The EstimateStripByteCounts function in TIFF library (libtiff) before 3.8.2 uses a 16-bit unsigned short when iterating over an unsigned 32-bit value, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service via a large td_nstrips value, which triggers an infinite loop.",
