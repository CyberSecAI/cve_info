    "description": "SQL injection vulnerability in search.php in Phorum 5.1.14 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the page parameter. NOTE the vendor has disputed this report, stating If a non positive integer or non-integer is used for the page parameter for a search URL, the search query will use a negative number for the LIMIT clause. This causes the query to break, showing no results. It IS NOT however a sql injection error. While the original report is from a researcher with mixed accuracy, as of 20060703, CVE does not have any additional information regarding this issue",
