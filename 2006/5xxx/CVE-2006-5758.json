    "description": "The Graphics Rendering Engine in Microsoft Windows 2000 through 2000 SP4 and Windows XP through SP2 maps GDI Kernel structures on a global shared memory section that is mapped with read-only permissions, but can be remapped by other processes as read-write, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and crash) and gain privileges by modifying the kernel structures.",
