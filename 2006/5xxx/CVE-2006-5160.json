    "description": "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox have unspecified vectors and impact, as claimed during ToorCon 2006. NOTE the vendor and original researchers have released a follow-up comment disputing this issue, in which one researcher states that I have no undisclosed Firefox vulnerabilities. The person who was speaking with me made this claim, and I honestly have no idea if he has them or not.",
