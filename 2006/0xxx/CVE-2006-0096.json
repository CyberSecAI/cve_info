    "description": "wan/sdla.c in Linux kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.11 and 2.4.x before 2.4.29 does not require the CAP_SYS_RAWIO privilege for an SDLA firmware upgrade, with unknown impact and local attack vectors. NOTE further investigation suggests that this issue requires root privileges to exploit, since it is protected by CAP_NET_ADMIN thus it might not be a vulnerability, although capabilities provide finer distinctions between privilege levels.",
