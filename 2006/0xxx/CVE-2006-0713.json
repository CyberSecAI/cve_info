    "description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in LinPHA 1.0 allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files via .. (dot dot) sequences in the (1) lang parameter in docs/index.php and the language parameter in (2) install/install.php, (3) install/sec_stage_install.php, (4) install/third_stage_install.php, and (5) install/forth_stage_install.php. NOTE direct static code injection is resultant from this issue, as demonstrated by inserting PHP code into the username, which is inserted into linpha.log, which is accessible from the directory traversal.",
