    "description": "Multiple memory leaks in IBM Lotus Notes and Domino Server before 6.5.5 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and crash) via unknown vectors related to (1) unspecified vectors during the SSL handshake (SPR# MKIN67MQVW), (2) the stash file during the SSL handshake (SPR# MKIN693QUT), and possibly other vectors. NOTE due to insufficient information in the original vendor advisory, it is not clear whether there is an attacker role in other memory leaks that are specified in the advisory.",
