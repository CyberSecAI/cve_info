    "description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in SAP Business Connector (BC) 4.6 and 4.7 allows remote attackers to read or delete arbitrary files via the fullName parameter to (1) sapbc/SAP/chopSAPLog.dsp or (2) invoke/sap.monitor.rfcTrace/deleteSingle. Details will be updated after the grace period has ended. NOTE SAP Business Connector is an OEM version of webMethods Integration Server. webMethods states that this issue can only occur when the product is installed as root/admin, and if the attacker has access to a general purpose port however, both are discouraged in the documentation. In addition, the attacker must already have acquired administrative privileges through other means.",
