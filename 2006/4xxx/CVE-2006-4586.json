    "description": "The admin panel in Tr Forum 2.0 accepts a username and password hash for authentication, which allows remote authenticated users to perform unauthorized actions, as demonstrated by modifying user settings via the id parameter to /membres/modif_profil.php, and changing a password via /membres/change_mdp.php. NOTE this can be leveraged with other Tr Forum vulnerabilities to allow unauthenticated attackers to gain privileges.",
