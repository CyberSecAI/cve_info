  "description": "The squeue_drain function in Sun Solaris 10, possibly only when run on CMT processors, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (bad trap and system panic) by opening and closing a large number of TCP connections (heavy TCP/IP loads). NOTE the original report specifies the function name as drain_squeue, but this is likely incorrect.",
