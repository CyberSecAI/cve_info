    "description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in RevoBoard 1.8, as derived from PunBB, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a substitution cipher of the email tag, which is transformed when the applications e-mail address obfuscator reverses the transformation.
