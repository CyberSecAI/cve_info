    "description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Pixelpost 1.5 beta 1 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the showimage parameter in index.php and the (2) USER_AGENT, (3) HTTP_REFERER, and (4) HTTP_HOST HTTP header fields as used in the book_vistor function in includes/functions.php. NOTE the vendor has disputed some issues from the original disclosure, but due to the vagueness of the dispute, it is not clear whether the vendor is disputing this particular issue.",
