    "description": "Buffer overflow in the parse function in parse.c in zoo 2.10 might allow local users to execute arbitrary code via long filename command line arguments, which are not properly handled during archive creation. NOTE since this issue is local and not setuid, the set of attack scenarios is limited, although is reasonable to expect that there are some situations in which the zoo user might automatically list attacker-controlled filenames to add to the zoo archive.",
