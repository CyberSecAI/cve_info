  "description": "Argument injection vulnerability in certain PHP 4.x and 5.x applications, when used with sendmail and when accepting remote input for the additional_parameters argument to the mb_send_mail function, allows context-dependent attackers to read and create arbitrary files by providing extra -C and -X arguments to sendmail. NOTE it could be argued that this is a class of technology-specific vulnerability, instead of a particular instance if so, then this should not be included in CVE.",
