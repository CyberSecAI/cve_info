    "description": "Nessus before 2.2.8, and 3.x before 3.0.3, allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a NASL script that calls split with an invalid sep parameter. NOTE a design goal of the NASL language is to facilitate sharing of security tests by guaranteeing that a script can not do anything nasty. This issue is appropriate for CVE only if Nessus users have an expectation that a split statement will not use excessive memory.",
