    "description": "Jelsoft vBulletin accepts uploads of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and processes them in a way that allows remote authenticated administrators to gain shell access by uploading a CSS file that contains PHP code, then selecting the file via the style chooser, which causes the PHP code to be executed. NOTE the vendor was unable to reproduce this issue in 3.5.x. NOTE this issue might be due to direct static code injection.",
