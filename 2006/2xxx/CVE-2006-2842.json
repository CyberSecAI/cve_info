    "description": "PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in functions/plugin.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.6 and earlier, if register_globals is enabled and magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the plugins array parameter. NOTE this issue has been disputed by third parties, who state that Squirrelmail provides prominent warnings to the administrator when register_globals is enabled. Since the varieties of administrator negligence are uncountable, perhaps this type of issue should not be included in CVE. However, the original developer has posted a security advisory, so there might be relevant real-world environments under which this vulnerability is applicable",
