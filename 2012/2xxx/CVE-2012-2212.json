    "description": "McAfee Web Gateway 7.0 allows remote attackers to bypass the access configuration for the CONNECT method by providing an arbitrary allowed hostname in the Host HTTP header. NOTE this issue might not be reproducible, because the researcher did not provide configuration details for the vulnerable system, and the observed behavior might be consistent with a configuration that was (perhaps inadvertently) designed to allow access based on Host HTTP headers",
