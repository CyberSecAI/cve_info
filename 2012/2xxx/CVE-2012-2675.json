    "description": "Multiple integer overflows in the (1) CallMalloc (malloc) and (2) nedpcalloc (calloc) functions in nedmalloc (nedmalloc.c) before 1.10 beta2 make it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.",
