    "description": "Integer overflow in the ordered_malloc function in boost/pool/pool.hpp in Boost Pool before 3.9 makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large memory chunk size value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.",
