    "description": "The TAR file parser in Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal) 11.00, NOD32 Antivirus 5795, Norman Antivirus 6.06.12, and Rising Antivirus 22.83.00.03 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR file with an initial ITSF character sequence. NOTE this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the error occurred independently in different TAR parser implementations.",
