  "description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the read function in filters/words/msword-odf/wv2/src/styles.cpp in the Microsoft import filter in Calligra 2.4.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted ODF style in an ODF document. NOTE this is the same vulnerability as CVE-2012-3455, but it was SPLIT by the CNA even though Calligra and KOffice share the same codebase.",
