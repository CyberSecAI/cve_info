  "description": "Multiple integer underflows in the icmLut_allocate function in International Color Consortium (ICC) Format library (icclib), as used in Ghostscript 9.06 and Argyll Color Management System, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) PostScript or (2) PDF file with embedded images, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
