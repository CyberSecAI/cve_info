    "description": "F-Secure Anti-Virus does not properly interact with the processing of hcp// URLs by the Microsoft Help and Support Center, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malware that is correctly detected by this product, but with a detection approach that occurs too late to stop the code execution. NOTE the researcher indicates that a vendor response was received, stating that the inability to catch these files are caused by lacking functionality rather than programming errors.",
