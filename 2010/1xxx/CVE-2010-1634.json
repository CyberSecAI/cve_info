    "description": "Multiple integer overflows in audioop.c in the audioop module in Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.2 allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a large fragment, as demonstrated by a call to audioop.lin2lin with a long string in the first argument, leading to a buffer overflow.
