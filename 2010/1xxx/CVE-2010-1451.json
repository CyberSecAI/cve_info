    "description": "The TSB I-TLB load implementation in arch/sparc/kernel/tsb.S in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33 on the SPARC platform does not properly obtain the value of a certain _PAGE_EXEC_4U bit and consequently does not properly implement a non-executable stack, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to exploit stack-based buffer overflows via a crafted application.",
