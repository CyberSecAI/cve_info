    "description": "The hci_uart_tty_open function in the HCI UART driver (drivers/bluetooth/hci_ldisc.c) in the Linux kernel 2.6.36, and possibly other versions, does not verify whether the tty has a write operation, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via vectors related to the Bluetooth driver.",
