    "description": "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Starting in version 0.2.9 and prior to version 0.3.10, locks of the type `@nonreentrant()` or `@nonreentrant()` do not produce reentrancy checks at runtime. This issue is fixed in version 0.3.10. As a workaround, ensure the lock name is a non-empty string.",
