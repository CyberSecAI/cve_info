Starting in the 2.x branch and prior to versions 2.0.1 and 3.0.1, when the `++api++` traverser is accidentally used multiple times in a url, handling it takes increasingly longer, making the server less responsive. Patches are available in `plone.rest` 2.0.1 and 3.0.1. Series 1.x is not affected. As a workaround, one may redirect `/++api++/++api++` to `/++api++` in ones frontend web server (nginx, Apache).",
