    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel ipv4 stack. The socket buffer (skb) was assumed to be associated with a device before calling __ip_options_compile, which is not always the case if the skb is re-routed by ipvs. This issue may allow a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to crash the system.",
