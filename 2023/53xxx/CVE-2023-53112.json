  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/i915/sseu fix max_subslices array-index-out-of-bounds access It seems that commit bc3c5e0809ae (drm/i915/sseu Dont try to store EU mask internally in UAPI format) exposed a potential out-of-bounds access, reported by UBSAN as following on a laptop with a gen 11 i915 card UBSAN array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gt/intel_sseu.c6527 index 6 is out of range for type u16 [6] CPU 2 PID 165 Comm systemd-udevd Not tainted 6.2.0-9-generic #9-Ubuntu Hardware name Dell Inc.

According to the definition of sseu_dev_info, eu_mask->hsw is limited to a maximum of GEN_MAX_SS_PER_HSW_SLICE (6) sub-slices, but gen11_sseu_info_init() can potentially set 8 sub-slices, in the !IS_JSL_EHL(gt->i915) case. Fix this by reserving up to 8 slots for max_subslices in the eu_mask struct. (cherry picked from commit 3cba09a6ac86ea1d456909626eb2685596c07822)",
