    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ice xsk disable txq irq before flushing hw ice_qp_dis() intends to stop a given queue pair that is a target of xsk pool attach/detach. One of the steps is to disable interrupts on these queues. It currently is broken in a way that txq irq is turned off *after* HW flush which in turn takes no effect. ice_qp_dis() -> ice_qvec_dis_irq() --> disable rxq irq --> flush hw -> ice_vsi_stop_tx_ring() -->disable txq irq Below splat can be triggered by following steps - start xdpsock WITHOUT loading xdp prog - run xdp_rxq_info with XDP_TX action on this interface - start traffic - terminate xdpsock [ 256.312485]",
