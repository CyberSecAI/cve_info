    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tracing Do not let histogram values have some modifiers Histogram values can not be strings, stacktraces, graphs, symbols, syscalls, or grouped in buckets or log. Give an error if a value is set to do so. Note, the histogram code was not prepared to handle these modifiers for histograms and caused a bug.
