    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb ucsi Fix NULL pointer deref in ucsi_connector_change() When ucsi_init() fails, ucsi->connector is NULL, yet in case of ucsi_acpi we may still get events which cause the ucs_acpi code to call ucsi_connector_change(), which then derefs the NULL ucsi->connector pointer. Fix this by not setting ucsi->ntfy inside ucsi_init() until ucsi_init() has succeeded, so that ucsi_connector_change() ignores the events because UCSI_ENABLE_NTFY_CONNECTOR_CHANGE is not set in the ntfy mask.",
