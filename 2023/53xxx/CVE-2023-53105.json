    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/mlx5e Fix cleanup null-ptr deref on encap lock During module is unloaded while a peer tc flow is still offloaded, first the peer uplink rep profile is changed to a nic profile, and so neigh encap lock is destroyed. Next during unload, the VF reps netdevs are unregistered which causes the original non-peer tc flow to be deleted, which deletes the peer flow. The peer flow deletion detaches the encap entry and try to take the already destroyed encap lock, causing the below trace. Fix this by clearing peer flows during tc eswitch cleanup (mlx5e_tc_esw_cleanup()). Relevant trace [ 4316.837128]",
