    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/i915 Fix a memory leak with reused mmap_offset drm_vma_node_allow() and drm_vma_node_revoke() should be called in balanced pairs. We call drm_vma_node_allow() once per-file everytime a user calls mmap_offset, but only call drm_vma_node_revoke once per-file on each mmap_offset. As the mmap_offset is reused by the client, the per-file vm_count may remain non-zero and the rbtree leaked. Call drm_vma_node_allow_once() instead to prevent that memory leak.",
