    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net usb lan78xx Limit packet length to skb->len Packet length retrieved from descriptor may be larger than the actual socket buffer length. In such case the cloned skb passed up the network stack will leak kernel memory contents. Additionally prevent integer underflow when size is less than ETH_FCS_LEN.",
