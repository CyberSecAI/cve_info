    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter nft_payload incorrect arithmetics when fetching VLAN header bits If the offset + length goes over the ethernet + vlan header, then the length is adjusted to copy the bytes that are within the boundaries of the vlan_ethhdr scratchpad area. The remaining bytes beyond ethernet + vlan header are copied directly from the skbuff data area. Fix incorrect arithmetic operator subtract, not add, the size of the vlan header in case of double-tagged packets to adjust the length accordingly to address CVE-2023-0179.",
