    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved EDAC/qcom Do not pass llcc_driv_data as edac_device_ctl_infos pvt_info The memory for llcc_driv_data is allocated by the LLCC driver. But when it is passed as the private driver info to the EDAC core, it will get freed during the qcom_edac driver release. So when the qcom_edac driver gets probed again, it will try to use the freed data leading to the use-after-free bug. Hence, do not pass llcc_driv_data as pvt_info but rather reference it using the platform_data pointer in the qcom_edac driver.",
