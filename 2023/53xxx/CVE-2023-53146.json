    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media dw2102 Fix null-ptr-deref in dw2102_i2c_transfer() In dw2102_i2c_transfer, msg is controlled by user. When msg[i].buf is null and msg[i].len is zero, former checks on msg[i].buf would be passed. Malicious data finally reach dw2102_i2c_transfer. If accessing msg[i].buf[0] without sanity check, null ptr deref would happen. We add check on msg[i].len to prevent crash. Similar commit commit 950e252cb469 ([media] dw2102 limit messages to buffer size)",
