    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nfc st-nci Fix use after free bug in ndlc_remove due to race condition This bug influences both st_nci_i2c_remove and st_nci_spi_remove. Take st_nci_i2c_remove as an example. In st_nci_i2c_probe, it called ndlc_probe and bound &ndlc->sm_work with llt_ndlc_sm_work. When it calls ndlc_recv or timeout handler, it will finally call schedule_work to start the work. When we call st_nci_i2c_remove to remove the driver, there may be a sequence as follows Fix it by finishing the work before cleanup in ndlc_remove CPU0 CPU1 |llt_ndlc_sm_work st_nci_i2c_remove | ndlc_remove | st_nci_remove | nci_free_device| kfree(ndev) | //free ndlc->ndev | |llt_ndlc_rcv_queue |nci_recv_frame |//use ndlc->ndev",
