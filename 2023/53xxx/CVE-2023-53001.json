    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/drm_vma_manager Add drm_vma_node_allow_once() Currently there is no easy way for a drm driver to safely check and allow drm_vma_offset_node for a drm file just once. Allow drm drivers to call non-refcounted version of drm_vma_node_allow() so that a driver doesnt need to keep track of each drm_vma_node_allow() to call subsequent drm_vma_node_revoke() to prevent memory leak.",
