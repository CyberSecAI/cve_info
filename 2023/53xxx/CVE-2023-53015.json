    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved HID betop check shape of output reports betopff_init() only checks the total sum of the report counts for each report field to be at least 4, but hid_betopff_play() expects 4 report fields. A device advertising an output report with one field and 4 report counts would pass the check but crash the kernel with a NULL pointer dereference in hid_betopff_play().",
