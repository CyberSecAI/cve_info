    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved thermal core call put_device() only after device_register() fails put_device() shouldnt be called before a prior call to device_register(). __thermal_cooling_device_register() doesnt follow that properly and needs fixing. Also thermal_cooling_device_destroy_sysfs() is getting called unnecessarily on few error paths. Fix all this by placing the calls at the right place. Based on initial work done by Caleb Connolly.",
