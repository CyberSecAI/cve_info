    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved perf/x86/amd/core Always clear status for idx The variable status (which contains the unhandled overflow bits) is not being properly masked in some cases, displaying the following warning WARNING CPU 156 PID 475601 at arch/x86/events/amd/core.c972 amd_pmu_v2_handle_irq+0x216/0x270 This seems to be happening because the loop is being continued before the status bit being unset, in case x86_perf_event_set_period() returns 0. This is also causing an inconsistency because the handled counter is incremented, but the status bit is not cleaned. Move the bit cleaning together above, together when the handled counter is incremented.",
