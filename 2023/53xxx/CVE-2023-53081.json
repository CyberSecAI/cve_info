    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ocfs2 fix data corruption after failed write When buffered write fails to copy data into underlying page cache page, ocfs2_write_end_nolock() just zeroes out and dirties the page. This can leave dirty page beyond EOF and if page writeback tries to write this page before write succeeds and expands i_size, page gets into inconsistent state where page dirty bit is clear but buffer dirty bits stay set resulting in page data never getting written and so data copied to the page is lost. Fix the problem by invalidating page beyond EOF after failed write.",
