    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tee amdtee fix race condition in amdtee_open_session There is a potential race condition in amdtee_open_session that may lead to use-after-free. For instance, in amdtee_open_session() after sess->sess_mask is set, and before setting sess->session_info[i] = session_info if amdtee_close_session() closes this same session, then sess data structure will be released, causing kernel panic when sess is accessed within amdtee_open_session(). The solution is to set the bit sess->sess_mask as the last step in amdtee_open_session().",
