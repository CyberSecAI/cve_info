    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved loop Fix use-after-free issues do_req_filebacked() calls blk_mq_complete_request() synchronously or asynchronously when using asynchronous I/O unless memory allocation fails. Hence, modify loop_handle_cmd() such that it does not dereference cmd nor rq after do_req_filebacked() finished unless we are sure that the request has not yet been completed.
