    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter ipset Fix overflow before widen in the bitmap_ip_create() function. When first_ip is 0, last_ip is 0xFFFFFFFF, and netmask is 31, the value of an arithmetic expression 2 << (netmask - mask_bits - 1) is subject to overflow due to a failure casting operands to a larger data type before performing the arithmetic. Note that its harmless since the value will be checked at the next step. Found by InfoTeCS on behalf of Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
