    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i40e Fix kernel crash during reboot when adapter is in recovery mode If the driver detects during probe that firmware is in recovery mode then i40e_init_recovery_mode() is called and the rest of probe function is skipped including pci_set_drvdata(). Subsequent i40e_shutdown() called during shutdown/reboot dereferences NULL pointer as pci_get_drvdata() returns NULL. To fix call pci_set_drvdata() also during entering to recovery mode. Reproducer 1) Lets have i40e NIC with firmware in recovery mode 2) Run reboot Result [ 139.084698] i40e Intel(R) Ethernet Connection XL710 Network Driver [ 139.090959] i40e Copyright (c) 2013 - 2019 Intel Corporation.
