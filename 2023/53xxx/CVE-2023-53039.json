    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved HID intel-ish-hid ipc Fix potential use-after-free in work function When a reset notify IPC message is received, the ISR schedules a work function and passes the ISHTP device to it via a global pointer ishtp_dev. If ish_probe() fails, the devm-managed device resources including ishtp_dev are freed, but the work is not cancelled, causing a use-after-free when the work function tries to access ishtp_dev. Use devm_work_autocancel() instead, so that the work is automatically cancelled if probe fails.",
