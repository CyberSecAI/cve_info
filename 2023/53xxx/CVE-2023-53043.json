    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved arm64 dts qcom sc7280 Mark PCIe controller as cache coherent If the controller is not marked as cache coherent, then kernel will try to ensure coherency during dma-ops and that may cause data corruption. So, mark the PCIe node as dma-coherent as the devices on PCIe bus are cache coherent.",
