  "description": "D-Link G416 cfgsave backusb Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link G416 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the HTTP service listening on TCP port 80. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-21288.",
