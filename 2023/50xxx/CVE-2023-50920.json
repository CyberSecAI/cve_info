    "description": "An issue was discovered on GL.iNet devices before version 4.5.0. They assign the same session ID after each user reboot, allowing attackers to share session identifiers between different sessions and bypass authentication or access control measures. Attackers can impersonate legitimate users or perform unauthorized actions. This affects A1300 4.4.6, AX1800 4.4.6, AXT1800 4.4.6, MT3000 4.4.6, MT2500 4.4.6, MT6000 4.5.0, MT1300 4.3.7, MT300N-V2 4.3.7, AR750S 4.3.7, AR750 4.3.7, AR300M 4.3.7, and B1300 4.3.7.",
