    "description": "emdns_resolve_raw in emdns.c in emdns through fbd1eef calls strlen with an input that may not be \\0 terminated, leading to a stack-based buffer over-read. This can be triggered by a remote adversary that can send DNS requests to the emdns server. The impact could vary depending on the system libraries, compiler, and processor architecture. Code before be565c3 is unaffected.",
