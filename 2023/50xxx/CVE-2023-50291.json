    "description": "Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system properties that had password contained in the name.There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as basicauth and aws.secretKey do not contain password, thus their values were published via the /admin/info/properties endpoint.This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the config-read permission.Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the config-read permission.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue.A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints, -Dsolr.hiddenSysProps.By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including -Dbasicauth), as well as any property with a name containing secret or password.Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue -Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=.*(password|secret|basicauth).*",
