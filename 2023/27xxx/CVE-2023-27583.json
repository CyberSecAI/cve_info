    "description": "PanIndex is a network disk directory index. In Panindex prior to version 3.1.3, a hard-coded JWT key `PanIndex` is used. An attacker can use the hard-coded JWT key to sign JWT token and perform any actions as a user with admin privileges. Version 3.1.3 has a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may change the JWT key in the source code before compiling the project.",
