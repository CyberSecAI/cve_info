  "description": "NETGEAR RAX30 soap_serverd Stack-based Buffer Overflow Authentication Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR RAX30 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the soap_serverd binary. When parsing SOAP message headers, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-19839.",
