    "description": "Remult is a CRUD framework for full-stack TypeScript. If you used the apiPrefilter option of the `@Entity` decorator, by setting it to a function that returns a filter that prevents unauthorized access to data, an attacker who knows the `id` of an entity instance is not authorized to access, can gain read, update and delete access to it. The issue is fixed in version 0.20.6. As a workaround, set the `apiPrefilter` option to a filter object instead of a function.",
