    "description": "An issue was discovered in YSoft SAFEQ 6 Server before 6.0.82. When modifying the URL of the LDAP server configuration from LDAPS to LDAP, the system does not require the password to be (re)entered. This results in exposing cleartext credentials when connecting to a rogue LDAP server. NOTE the vendor originally reported this as a security issue but then reconsidered because of the requirement for Admin access in order to change the configuration.",
