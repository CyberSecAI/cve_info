    "description": "An Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability in the management daemon (mgd) process of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based authenticated low-privileged attacker, by executing a specific command via NETCONF, to cause a CPU Denial of Service to the devices control plane. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS * All versions prior to 20.4R3-S7 * 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S5 * 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5 * 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S4 * 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S2 * 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3 * 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S1, 22.3R3 * 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R1-S2, 22.4R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved * All versions prior to 21.4R3-S4-EVO * 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S2-EVO * 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-EVO * 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R3-EVO * 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2-EVO. An indicator of compromise can be seen by first determining if the NETCONF client is logged in and fails to log out after a reasonable period of time and secondly reviewing the WCPU percentage for the mgd process by running the following command mgd process example user@device-re#> show system processes extensive | match mgd|PID | except last PID USERNAME PRI NICE SIZE RES STATE C TIME WCPU COMMAND 92476 root 100 0 500M 89024K CPU3 3 57.5H 89.60% mgd <<<<<<<<<<< review the high cpu percentage.
