    "description": "D-Link DIR-X3260 prog.cgi Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm Authentication Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of D-Link DIR-X3260 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the prog.cgi executable. The issue results from an incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the device. Was ZDI-CAN-21100.",
