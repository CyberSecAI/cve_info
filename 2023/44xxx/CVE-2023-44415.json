    "description": "D-Link Multiple Routers cli Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-1260 and DIR-2150 routers. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the CLI service, which listens on TCP port 23. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. . Was ZDI-CAN-19946.",
