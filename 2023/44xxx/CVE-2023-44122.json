    "description": "The vulnerability is to theft of arbitrary files with system privilege in the LockScreenSettings (com.lge.lockscreensettings) app in the com/lge/lockscreensettings/dynamicwallpaper/MyCategoryGuideActivity.java file. The main problem is that the app launches implicit intents that can be intercepted by third-party apps installed on the same device. They also can return arbitrary data that will be passed to the onActivityResult() method. The LockScreenSettings app copies the received file to the /data/shared/dw/mycategory/wallpaper_01.png path and then changes the file access mode to world-readable and world-writable.",
