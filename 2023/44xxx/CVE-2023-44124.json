    "description": "The vulnerability is to theft of arbitrary files with system privilege in the Screen recording (com.lge.gametools.gamerecorder) app in the com/lge/gametools/gamerecorder/settings/ProfilePreferenceFragment.java file. The main problem is that the app launches implicit intents that can be intercepted by third-party apps installed on the same device. They also can return arbitrary data that will be passed to the onActivityResult() method. The Screen recording app saves contents of arbitrary URIs to SD card which is a world-readable storage.",
