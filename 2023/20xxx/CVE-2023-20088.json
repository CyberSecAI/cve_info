    "description": "A vulnerability in the nginx configurations that are provided as part of the VPN-less reverse proxy for Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition for new and existing users who are connected through a load balancer. This vulnerability is due to improper IP address filtering by the reverse proxy. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of unauthenticated requests to the reverse proxy. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all current traffic and subsequent requests to the reverse proxy through a load balancer to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.",
