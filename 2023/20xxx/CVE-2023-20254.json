    "description": "A vulnerability in the session management system of the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager multi-tenant feature could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access another tenant that is being managed by the same Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager instance. This vulnerability requires the multi-tenant feature to be enabled. This vulnerability is due to insufficient user session management within the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to information about another tenant, make configuration changes, or possibly take a tenant offline causing a denial of service condition.",
