This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to a specific API endpoint on the Unified CCX Finesse Portal. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the internal WebProxy to redirect users to an attacker-controlled host.",
