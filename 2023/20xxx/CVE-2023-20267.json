    "description": "A vulnerability in the IP geolocation rules of Snort 3 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to potentially bypass IP address restrictions. This vulnerability exists because the configuration for IP geolocation rules is not parsed properly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by spoofing an IP address until they bypass the restriction. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass location-based IP address restrictions.",
