    "description": "A vulnerability in the AnyConnect SSL VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to send packets with another VPN users source IP address. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of the packets inner source IP address after decryption. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets through the tunnel. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send a packet impersonating another VPN users IP address. It is not possible for the attacker to receive return packets.",
