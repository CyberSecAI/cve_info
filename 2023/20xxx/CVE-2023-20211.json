    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a user with read-only or higher privileges and sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or modify data in the underlying database or elevate their privileges.",
