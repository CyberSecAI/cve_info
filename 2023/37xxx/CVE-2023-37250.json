    "description": "Unity Parsec has a TOCTOU race condition that permits local attackers to escalate privileges to SYSTEM if Parsec was installed in Per User mode. The application intentionally launches DLLs from a user-owned directory but intended to always perform integrity verification of those DLLs. This affects Parsec Loader versions through 8. Parsec Loader 9 is a fixed version.",
