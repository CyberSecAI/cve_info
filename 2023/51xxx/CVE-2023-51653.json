    "description": "Hertzbeat is a real-time monitoring system. In the implementation of `JmxCollectImpl.java`, `JMXConnectorFactory.connect` is vulnerable to JNDI injection. The corresponding interface is `/api/monitor/detect`. If there is a URL field, the address will be used by default. When the URL is `servicejmxrmi///jndi/rmi//xxxxxxx1099/localHikari`, it can be exploited to cause remote code execution. Version 1.4.1 contains a fix for this issue.",
