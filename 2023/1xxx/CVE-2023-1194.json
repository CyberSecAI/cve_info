    "description": "An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory read flaw was found in parse_lease_state in the KSMBD implementation of the in-kernel samba server and CIFS in the Linux kernel. When an attacker sends the CREATE command with a malformed payload to KSMBD, due to a missing check of `NameOffset` in the `parse_lease_state()` function, the `create_context` object can access invalid memory.",
