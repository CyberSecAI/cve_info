    "description": "An Unexpected Status Code or Return Value vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to the device to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When certain USB devices are connected to a USB port of the routing-engine (RE), the kernel will crash leading to a reboot of the device. The device will continue to crash as long as the USB device is connected.
