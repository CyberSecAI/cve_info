    "description": "lambdaisland/uri is a pure Clojure/ClojureScript URI library. In versions prior to 1.14.120 `authority-regex` allows an attacker to send malicious URLs to be parsed by the `lambdaisland/uri` and return the wrong authority. This issue is similar to but distinct from CVE-2020-8910. The regex in question doesnt handle the backslash (`\\`) character in the username correctly, leading to a wrong output. ex. a payload of `https//example.com\\\\@google.com` would return that the host is `google.com`, but the correct host should be `example.com`. Given that the library returns the wrong authority this may be abused to bypass host restrictions depending on how the library is used in an application. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
