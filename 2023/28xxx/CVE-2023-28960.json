  "description": "An Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a local, authenticated low-privileged attacker to copy potentially malicious files into an existing Docker container on the local system. A follow-on administrator could then inadvertently start the Docker container leading to the malicious files being executed as root. This issue only affects systems with Docker configured and enabled, which is not enabled by default. Systems without Docker started are not vulnerable to this issue. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S5-EVO 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-EVO 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-EVO 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 19.2R1-EVO.",
