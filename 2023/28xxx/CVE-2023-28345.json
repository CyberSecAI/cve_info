The Insight Teacher Console application exposes the teachers Console password in cleartext via an API endpoint accessible from localhost. Attackers with physical access to the Teacher Console can open a web browser, navigate to the affected endpoint and obtain the teachers password. This enables them to log into the Teacher Console and begin trivially attacking student machines.",
