    "description": "The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion in versions 1.0.8 to 1.3.9 via the content-dir HTTP header. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include remote files on the server, resulting in code execution. NOTE Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that the target servers php.ini is configured with allow_url_include set to on. This feature is deprecated as of PHP 7.4 and is disabled by default, but can still be explicitly enabled in later versions of PHP.",
