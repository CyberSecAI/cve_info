    "description": "A flaw was found in the Quarkus Cache Runtime. When request processing utilizes a Uni cached using @CacheResult and the cached Uni reuses the initial completion context, the processing switches to the cached Uni instead of the request context. This is a problem if the cached Uni context contains sensitive information, and could allow a malicious user to benefit from a POST request returning the response that is meant for another user, gaining access to sensitive data.",
