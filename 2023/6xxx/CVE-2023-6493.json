    "description": "The Depicter Slider Responsive Image Slider, Video Slider & Post Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugins settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. CVE-2023-51491 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.",
