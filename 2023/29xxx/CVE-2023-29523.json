    "description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any user who can edit their own user profile can execute arbitrary script macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code execution including unrestricted read and write access to all wiki contents. The same vulnerability can also be exploited in other contexts where the `display` method on a document is used to display a field with wiki syntax, for example in applications created using `App Within Minutes`. This has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.8, 14.10.2 and 15.0RC1. There is no workaround apart from upgrading.",
