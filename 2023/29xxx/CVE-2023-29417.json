    "description": "An issue was discovered in libbzip3.a in bzip3 1.2.2. There is a bz3_decompress out-of-bounds read in certain situations where buffers passed to bzip3 do not contain enough space to be filled with decompressed data. NOTE the vendors perspective is that the observed behavior can only occur for a contract violation, and thus the report is invalid.",
