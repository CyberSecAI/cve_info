    "description": "For Kiuwan installations with SSO (single sign-on) enabled, an unauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting attack can be performed on the login page login.html. This is possible due to the request parameter message values being directly included in a JavaScript block in the response. This is especially critical in business environments using AD SSO authentication, e.g. via ADFS, where attackers could potentially steal AD passwords.
