    "description": "Ariel Harush and Roy Hodir from OTORIO have found a flaw in the AXIS A1001 when communicating over OSDP. A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the pacsiod process which is handling the OSDP communication allowing to write outside of the allocated buffer. By appending invalid data to an OSDP message it was possible to write data beyond the heap allocated buffer. The data written outside the buffer could be used to execute arbitrary code. lease refer to the Axis security advisory for more information, mitigation and affected products and software versions.",
