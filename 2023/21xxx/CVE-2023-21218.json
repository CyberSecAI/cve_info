    "description": "In PMRChangeSparseMemOSMem of physmem_osmem_linux.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an incorrect bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
