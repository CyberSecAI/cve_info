    "description": "The fixes for XSA-422 (Branch Type Confusion) and XSA-434 (SpeculativeReturn Stack Overflow) are not IRQ-safe. It was believed that themitigations always operated in contexts with IRQs disabled.However, the original XSA-254 fix for Meltdown (XPTI) deliberately leftinterrupts enabled on two entry paths one unconditionally, and oneconditionally on whether XPTI was active.As BTC/SRSO and Meltdown affect different CPU vendors, the mitigationsare not active together by default. Therefore, there is a racecondition whereby a malicious PV guest can bypass BTC/SRSO protectionsand launch a BTC/SRSO attack against Xen.",
