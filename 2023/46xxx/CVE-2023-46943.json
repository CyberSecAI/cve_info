    "description": "An issue was discovered in NPMs package @evershop/evershop before version 1.0.0-rc.8. The HMAC secret used for generating tokens is hardcoded as secret. A weak HMAC secret poses a risk because attackers can use the predictable secret to create valid JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), allowing them access to important information and actions within the application.",
