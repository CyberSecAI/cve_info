    "description": "browserify-sign is a package to duplicate the functionality of nodes crypto public key functions, much of this is based on Fedor Indutnys work on indutny/tls.js. An upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify` function allows an attacker to construct signatures that can be successfully verified by any public key, thus leading to a signature forgery attack. All places in this project that involve DSA verification of user-input signatures will be affected by this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 4.2.2.",
