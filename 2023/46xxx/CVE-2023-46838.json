    "description": "Transmit requests in Xens virtual network protocol can consist ofmultiple parts. While not really useful, except for the initial partany of them may be of zero length, i.e. carry no data at all. Besides acertain initial portion of the to be transferred data, these parts aredirectly translated into what Linux calls SKB fragments. Such convertedrequest parts can, when for a particular SKB they are all of lengthzero, lead to a de-reference of NULL in core networking code.",
