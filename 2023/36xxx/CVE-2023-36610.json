    "description": "The affected TBox RTUs generate software security tokens using insufficient entropy. The random seed used to generate the software tokens is not initialized correctly, and other parts of the token are generated using predictable time-based values. An attacker with this knowledge could successfully brute force the token and authenticate themselves.",
