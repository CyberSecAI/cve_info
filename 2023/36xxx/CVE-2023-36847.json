    "description": "A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the file system integrity.With a specific request to installAppPackage.php that doesnt require authentication an attacker is able to upload arbitrary files via J-Web, leading to a loss of integrityfor a certain part of the file system, which may allow chaining to other vulnerabilities.This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX Series * All versions prior to 20.4R3-S8 * 21.1 versions 21.1R1 and later * 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S6 * 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5 * 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S4 * 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S3 * 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S1 * 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3 * 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2-S1, 22.4R3.",
