    "description": "A certain software build for the Orbic Maui device (Orbic/RC545L/RC545L10/ORB545L_V1.4.2_BVZPP/230106user/release-keys) leaks the IMEI and the ICCID to system properties that can be accessed by any local app on the device without any permissions or special privileges. Google restricted third-party apps from directly obtaining non-resettable device identifiers in Android 10 and higher, but in this instance they are leaked by a high-privilege process and can be obtained indirectly. This malicious app reads from the persist.sys.verizon_test_plan_imei system property to indirectly obtain the IMEI and reads the persist.sys.verizon_test_plan_iccid system property to obtain the ICCID.",
