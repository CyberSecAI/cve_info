    "description": "ActiveSupportEncryptedFile writes contents that will be encrypted to a temporary file. The temporary files permissions are defaulted to the users current `umask` settings, meaning that its possible for other users on the same system to read the contents of the temporary file. Attackers that have access to the file system could possibly read the contents of this temporary file while a user is editing it. All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.",
