    "description": "An issue was discovered in a third-party component related to ro.boot.wifimacaddr, shipped on devices from multiple device manufacturers. Various software builds for the following TCL devices (30Z and 10L) and Motorola devices (Moto G Pure and Moto G Power) leak the Wi-Fi MAC address to a system property that can be accessed by any local app on the device without any permissions or special privileges. Google restricted third-party apps from directly obtaining non-resettable device identifiers in Android 10 and higher, but in these instances they are leaked by a high-privilege process and can be obtained indirectly. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable device are as follows TCL A3X (TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vAAZuser/release-keys, TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vAB3user/release-keys, TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vAB7user/release-keys, TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vABAuser/release-keys, TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vABMuser/release-keys, TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vABPuser/release-keys, and TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vABSuser/release-keys) TCL 10L (TCL/T770B/T1_LITE10/QKQ1.200329.002/3CJ0user/release-keys and TCL/T770B/T1_LITE11/RKQ1.210107.001/8BICuser/release-keys) Motorola Moto G Pure (motorola/ellis_trac/ellis11/RRHS31.Q3-46-110-2/74844user/release-keys, motorola/ellis_trac/ellis11/RRHS31.Q3-46-110-7/5cde8user/release-keys, motorola/ellis_trac/ellis11/RRHS31.Q3-46-110-10/d67faauser/release-keys, motorola/ellis_trac/ellis11/RRHS31.Q3-46-110-13/b4a29user/release-keys, motorola/ellis_trac/ellis12/S3RH32.20-42-10/1c2540user/release-keys, motorola/ellis_trac/ellis12/S3RHS32.20-42-13-2-1/6368dduser/release-keys, motorola/ellis_a/ellis11/RRH31.Q3-46-50-2/20fecuser/release-keys, motorola/ellis_vzw/ellis11/RRH31.Q3-46-138/103bduser/release-keys, motorola/ellis_vzw/ellis11/RRHS31.Q3-46-138-2/e5502user/release-keys, and motorola/ellis_vzw/ellis12/S3RHS32.20-42-10-14-2/5e0b0user/release-keys) and Motorola Moto G Power (motorola/tonga_g/tonga11/RRQ31.Q3-68-16-2/e5877user/release-keys and motorola/tonga_g/tonga12/S3RQS32.20-42-10-6/f876d3user/release-keys).
