    "description": "Various software builds for the following TCL devices (30Z, A3X, 20XE, 10L) leak the device IMEI to a system property that can be accessed by any local app on the device without any permissions or special privileges. Google restricted third-party apps from directly obtaining non-resettable device identifiers in Android 10 and higher, but in these instances they are leaked by a high-privilege process and can be obtained indirectly. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable device are as follows TCL 30Z (TCL/4188R/Jetta_ATT12/SP1A.210812.016/LV8Euser/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF12/SP1A.210812.016/vU5Puser/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF12/SP1A.210812.016/vU61user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF12/SP1A.210812.016/vU66user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF12/SP1A.210812.016/vU68user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF12/SP1A.210812.016/vU6Puser/release-keys, and TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF12/SP1A.210812.016/vU6Xuser/release-keys) TCL A3X (TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vAAZuser/release-keys, TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vAB3user/release-keys, TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vAB7user/release-keys, TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vABAuser/release-keys, TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vABMuser/release-keys, TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vABPuser/release-keys, and TCL/A600DL/Delhi_TF11/RKQ1.201202.002/vABSuser/release-keys) TCL 20XE (TCL/5087Z_BO/Doha_TMO11/RP1A.200720.011/PB7I-0user/release"
