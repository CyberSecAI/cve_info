    "description": "An issue was discovered in a third-party component related to vendor.gsm.serial, shipped on devices from multiple device manufacturers. Various software builds for the BLU View 2, Boost Mobile Celero 5G, Sharp Rouvo V, Motorola Moto G Pure, Motorola Moto G Power, T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, and T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G devices leak the device serial number to a system property that can be accessed by any local app on the device without any permissions or special privileges. Google restricted third-party apps from directly obtaining non-resettable device identifiers in Android 10 and higher, but in these instances they are leaked by a high-privilege process and can be obtained indirectly. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable device are as follows BLU View 2 (BLU/B131DL/B130DL11/RP1A.200720.011/1672046950user/release-keys) Boost Mobile Celero 5G (Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98119AA1_V067user/release-keys) Sharp Rouvo V (SHARP/VZW_STTM21VAPP/STTM21VAPP12/SP1A.210812.016/1KN0_0_530user/release-keys) Motorola Moto G Pure (motorola/ellis_trac/ellis11/RRHS31.Q3-46-110-2/74844user/release-keys, motorola/ellis_trac/ellis11/RRHS31.Q3-46-110-7/5cde8user/release-keys, motorola/ellis_trac/ellis11/RRHS31.Q3-46-110-10/d67faauser/release-keys, motorola/ellis_trac/ellis11/RRHS31.Q3-46-110-13/b4a29user/release-keys, motorola/ellis_trac/ellis12/S3RH32.20-42-10/1c2540user/release-keys, motorola/ellis_trac/ellis12/S3RHS32.20-42-13-2-1/6368",
