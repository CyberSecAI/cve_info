    "timestamp": "2024-12-06T11:32:07.789868+00:00",
    "description": "Certain software builds for the TCL 20XE Android device contain a vulnerable, pre-installed app with a package name of com.tct.gcs.hiddenmenuproxy (versionCode=2, versionName=v11.0.1.0.0201.0) that allows local third-party apps to programmatically perform a factory reset due to inadequate access control. No permissions or special privileges are necessary to exploit the vulnerability in the com.tct.gcs.hiddenmenuproxy app. No user interaction is required beyond installing and running a third-party app. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable build are as follows TCL/5087Z_BO/Doha_TMO11/RP1A.200720.011/PB7I-0user/release-keys and TCL/5087Z_BO/Doha_TMO11/RP1A.200720.011/PB83-0user/release-keys. This malicious app sends a broadcast intent to the exported com.tct.gcs.hiddenmenuproxy/.rtn.FactoryResetReceiver receiver component, which initiates a programmatic factory reset.",
