    "description": "Certain software builds for the TCL 30Z and TCL 10 Android devices contain a vulnerable, pre-installed app that relies on a missing permission that provides no protection at runtime. The missing permission is required as an access permission by components in various pre-installed apps. On the TCL 30Z device, the vulnerable app has a package name of com.tcl.screenrecorder (versionCode=1221092802, versionName=v5.2120.02.12008.1.T versionCode=1221092805, versionName=v5.2120.02.12008.2.T). On the TCL 10L device, the vulnerable app has a package name of com.tcl.sos (versionCode=2020102827, versionName=v3.2014.12.1012.B). When a third-party app declares and requests the missing permission, it can interact with certain service components in the aforementioned apps (that execute with system privileges) to perform arbitrary files reads/writes in its context. An app exploiting this vulnerability only needs to declare and request the single missing permission and no user interaction is required beyond installing and running a third-party app. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable device are as follows TCL 10L (TCL/T770B/T1_LITE11/RKQ1.210107.001/8BICuser/release-keys) and TCL 30Z (TCL/4188R/Jetta_ATT12/SP1A.210812.016/LV8Euser/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF12/SP1A.210812.016/vU5Puser/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF12/SP1A.210812.016/vU61user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF12/SP1A.210812.016/vU66user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta",
