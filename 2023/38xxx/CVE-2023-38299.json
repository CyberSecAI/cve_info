    "description": "Various software builds for the AT&T Calypso, Nokia C100, Nokia C200, and BLU View 3 devices leak the device IMEI to a system property that can be accessed by any local app on the device without any permissions or special privileges. Google restricted third-party apps from directly obtaining non-resettable device identifiers in Android 10 and higher, but in these instances they are leaked by a high-privilege process and can be obtained indirectly. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable device are as follows AT&T Calypso (ATT/U318AA/U318AA10/QP1A.190711.020/1632369780user/release-keys) Nokia C100 (Nokia/DrakeLite_02US/DKT12/SP1A.210812.016/02US_1_190user/release-keys and Nokia/DrakeLite_02US/DKT12/SP1A.210812.016/02US_1_270user/release-keys) Nokia C200 (Nokia/Drake_02US/DRK12/SP1A.210812.016/02US_1_080user/release-keys) and BLU View 3 (BLU/B140DL/B140DL11/RP1A.200720.011/1628014629user/release-keys, BLU/B140DL/B140DL11/RP1A.200720.011/1632535579user/release-keys, BLU/B140DL/B140DL11/RP1A.200720.011/1637325978user/release-keys, BLU/B140DL/B140DL11/RP1A.200720.011/1650073052user/release-keys, BLU/B140DL/B140DL11/RP1A.200720.011/1657087912user/release-keys, BLU/B140DL/B140DL11/RP1A.200720.011/1666316280user/release-keys, and BLU/B140DL/B140DL11/RP1A.200720.011/1672371162user/release-keys). This malicious app reads from the persist.sys.imei1 system property to indirectly obtain the device IMEI."
