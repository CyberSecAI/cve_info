    "description": "In sms_DecodeCodedTpMsg of sms_PduCodec.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a heap buffer overflow. This could lead to remote information disclosure if the attacker is able to observe the behavior of the subsequent switch conditional with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
