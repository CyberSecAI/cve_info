  "description": "A path traversal vulnerability was identified in the HL7 sensor in PRTG 23.2.84.1566 and earlier versions where an authenticated user with write permissions could trick the HL7 sensor into behaving differently for existing files and non-existing files. This made it possible to traverse paths, allowing the sensor to execute files outside the designated custom sensors folder. The severity of this vulnerability is medium and received a score of 4.7 CVSS3.1/AVN/ACL/PRH/UIN/SU/CL/IL/AL",
