    "description": "Code Dx versions prior to 2023.4.2 are vulnerable to user impersonation attack where a malicious actor is able to gain access to another users account by crafting a custom Remember Me token. This is possible due to the use of a hard-coded cipher which was used when generating the token. A malicious actor who creates this token can supply it to a separate Code Dx system, provided they know the username they want to impersonate, and impersonate the user.Score6.7 CVSS3.1/AVN/ACH/PRN/UIN/SU/CH/IH/AN/EP/RLO/RCC",
