    "description": "The WordPress File Upload and WordPress File Upload Pro plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 4.19.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
