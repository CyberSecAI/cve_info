    "description": "The Announcement & Notification Banner Bulletin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to a missing nonce validation on the bulletinwp_update_bulletin_status, bulletinwp_update_bulletin, bulletinwp_update_settings, bulletinwp_update_status, bulletinwp_export_bulletins, and bulletinwp_import_bulletins functions in versions up to, and including, 3.7.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugins settings, modify bulletins, create new bulletins, and more, via a forged request granted they can trick a sites user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
