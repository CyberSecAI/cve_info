    "description": "The Colibri Page Builder for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the post_id parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.0.227 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level privileges to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
