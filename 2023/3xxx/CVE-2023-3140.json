    "description": "Missing HTTP headers (X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy) in KNIME Business Hub before 1.4.0 has left users vulnerable to click jacking. Clickjacking is an attack that occurs when an attacker uses a transparent iframe in a window to trick a user into clicking on an actionable item, such as a button or link, to another server in which they have an identical webpage. The attacker essentially hijacks the user activity intended for the original server and sends them to the other server.",
