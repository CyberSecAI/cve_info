    "description": "The Beautiful Cookie Consent Banner for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the nsc_bar_content_href parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.10.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. A partial patch was made available in 2.10.1 and the issue was fully patched in 2.10.2.",
