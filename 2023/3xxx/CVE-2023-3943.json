  "description": "Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in ZkTeco-based OEM devices allows, in some cases, the execution of arbitrary code. Due to the lack of protection mechanisms such as stack canaries and PIE, it is possible to successfully execute code even under restrictive conditions. This issue affects ZkTeco-based OEM devices (ZkTeco ProFace X, Smartec ST-FR043, Smartec ST-FR041ME and possibly others) with firmware ZAM170-NF-1.8.25-7354-Ver1.0.0 and possibly others.",
