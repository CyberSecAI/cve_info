    "description": "The Comments Like Dislike plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the restore_settings function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.1.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to reset the plugins settings. NOTE After attempting to contact the developer with no response, and reporting this to the WordPress plugins team 30 days ago we are disclosing this issue as it still is not updated.",
