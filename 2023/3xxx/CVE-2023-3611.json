    "description": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernels net/sched sch_qfq component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The qfq_change_agg() function in net/sched/sch_qfq.c allows an out-of-bounds write because lmax is updated according to packet sizes without bounds checks. We recommend upgrading past commit 3e337087c3b5805fe0b8a46ba622a962880b5d64.",
