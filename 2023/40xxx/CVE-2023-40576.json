    "description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. Affected versions are subject to an Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `RleDecompress` function. This Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because FreeRDP processes the `pbSrcBuffer` variable without checking if it contains data of sufficient length. Insufficient data in the `pbSrcBuffer` variable may cause errors or crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
