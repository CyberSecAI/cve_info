    "description": "EmpowerID before 7.205.0.1 allows an attacker to bypass an MFA (multi factor authentication) requirement if the first factor (username and password) is known, because the first factor is sufficient to change an accounts email address, and the product would then send MFA codes to the new email address (which may be attacker-controlled). NOTE this is different from CVE-2023-4177, which claims to be about some unknown processing of the component Multi-Factor Authentication Code Handler and thus cannot be correlated with other vulnerability information.",
