    "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernels TUN/TAP functionality. This issue could allow a local user to bypass network filters and gain unauthorized access to some resources. The original patches fixing CVE-2023-1076 are incorrect or incomplete. The problem is that the following upstream commits - a096ccca6e50 (tun tun_chr_open() correctly initialize socket uid), - 66b2c338adce (tap tap_open() correctly initialize socket uid), pass inode->i_uid to sock_init_data_uid() as the last parameter and that turns out to not be accurate.",
