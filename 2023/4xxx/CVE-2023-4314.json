  "description": "The wpDataTables WordPress plugin before 2.1.66 does not validate the Serialized PHP array input data before deserializing the data. This allows admins to deserialize arbitrary data which may lead to remote code execution if a suitable gadget chain is present on the server. This is impactful in environments where admin users should not be allowed to execute arbitrary code, such as multisite.",
