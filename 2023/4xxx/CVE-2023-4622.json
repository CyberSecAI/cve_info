    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernels af_unix component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.The unix_stream_sendpage() function tries to add data to the last skb in the peers recv queue without locking the queue. Thus there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb locklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in use-after-free.We recommend upgrading past commit 790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c.",
