    "description": "When a transaction is committed, C Xenstored will first checkthe quota is correct before attempting to commit any nodes. It wouldbe possible that accounting is temporarily negative if a node hasbeen removed outside of the transaction.Unfortunately, some versions of C Xenstored are assuming that thequota cannot be negative and are using assert() to confirm it. Thiswill lead to C Xenstored crash when tools are built without -DNDEBUG(this is the default).",
