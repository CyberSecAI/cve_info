    "description": "The error page for sites with invalid TLS certificates was missing theactivation-delay Firefox uses to protect prompts and permission dialogsfrom attacks that exploit human response time delays. If a maliciouspage elicited user clicks in precise locations immediately beforenavigating to a site with a certificate error and made the rendererextremely busy at the same time, it could create a gap between whenthe error page was loaded and when the display actually refreshed.With the right timing the elicited clicks could land in that gap and activate the button that overrides the certificate error for that site. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.12, Firefox < 114, and Thunderbird < 102.12.",
