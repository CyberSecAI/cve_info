    "description": "The fix for XSA-423 added logic to Linuxes netback driver to deal witha frontend splitting a packet in a way such that not all of the headerswould come in one piece. Unfortunately the logic introduced theredidnt account for the extreme case of the entire packet being splitinto as many pieces as permitted by the protocol, yet still beingsmaller than the area thats specially dealt with to keep all (possible)headers together. Such an unusual packet would therefore trigger abuffer overrun in the driver.",
