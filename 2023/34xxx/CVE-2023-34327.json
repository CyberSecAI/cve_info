    "description": "[This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs thetext explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]AMD CPUs since ~2014 have extensions to normal x86 debugging functionality.Xen supports guests using these extensions.Unfortunately there are errors in Xens handling of the guest state, leadingto denials of service. 1) CVE-2023-34327 - An HVM vCPU can end up operating in the context of a previous vCPUs debug mask state. 2) CVE-2023-34328 - A PV vCPU can place a breakpoint over the live GDT. This allows the PV vCPU to exploit XSA-156 / CVE-2015-8104 and lock up the CPU entirely.",
