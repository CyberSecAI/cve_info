  "description": "[This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs thetext explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]libfsimage contains parsing code for several filesystems, most of them based ongrub-legacy code. libfsimage is used by pygrub to inspect guest disks.Pygrub runs as the same user as the toolstack (root in a priviledged domain).At least one issue has been reported to the Xen Security Team that allows anattacker to trigger a stack buffer overflow in libfsimage. After furtheranalisys the Xen Security Team is no longer confident in the suitability oflibfsimage when run against guest controlled input with super user priviledges.In order to not affect current deployments that rely on pygrub patches areprovided in the resolution section of the advisory that allow running pygrub indeprivileged mode.CVE-2023-4949 refers to the original issue in the upstream grubproject (An attacker with local access to a system (either through adisk or external drive) can present a modified XFS partition togrub-legacy in such a way to exploit a memory corruption in grubs XFSfile system implementation.) CVE-2023-34325 refers specifically tothe vulnerabilities in Xens copy of libfsimage, which is decendedfrom a very old version of grub.",
