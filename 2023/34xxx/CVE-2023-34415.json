  "description": "When choosing a site-isolated process for a document loaded from a data URL that was the result of a redirect, Firefox would load that document in the same process as the site that issued the redirect. This bypassed the site-isolation protections against Spectre-like attacks on sites that host an open redirect. Firefox no longer follows HTTP redirects to data URLs. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 114.",
