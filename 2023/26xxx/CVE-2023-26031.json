    "description": "Relative library resolution in linux container-executor binary in Apache Hadoop 3.3.1-3.3.4 on Linux allows local user to gain root privileges. If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote (authenticated) users, this MAY permit remote users to gain root privileges. Hadoop 3.3.0 updated the YARN Secure Containers https//hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/SecureContainer.html to add a feature for executing user-submitted applications in isolated linux containers. The native binary HADOOP_HOME/bin/container-executor is used to launch these containers it must be owned by root and have the suid bit set in order for the YARN processes to run the containers as the specific users submitting the jobs. The patch YARN-10495 https//issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-10495 . make the rpath of container-executor configurable modified the library loading path for loading .so files from $ORIGIN/ to $ORIGIN/../lib/native/. This is the a path through which libcrypto.so is located. Thus it is is possible for a user with reduced privileges to install a malicious libcrypto library into a path to which they have write access, invoke the container-executor command, and have their modified library executed as root. If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote (authenticated) users, and these users submitted job are executed in the physical host, rather than a container, then the CVE permits remote users to gain root privileges.
