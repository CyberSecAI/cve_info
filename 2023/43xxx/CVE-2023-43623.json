    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Forgot Password (Mendix 10 compatible) (All versions < V5.4.0), Mendix Forgot Password (Mendix 7 compatible) (All versions < V3.7.3), Mendix Forgot Password (Mendix 8 compatible) (All versions < V4.1.3), Mendix Forgot Password (Mendix 9 compatible) (All versions < V5.4.0). Applications using the affected module are vulnerable to user enumeration due to distinguishable responses. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to determine if a user is valid or not, enabling a brute force attack with valid users.",
