    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved PM / devfreq Fix buffer overflow in trans_stat_show Fix buffer overflow in trans_stat_show(). Convert simple snprintf to the more secure scnprintf with size of PAGE_SIZE. Add condition checking if we are exceeding PAGE_SIZE and exit early from loop. Also add at the end a warning that we exceeded PAGE_SIZE and that stats is disabled. Return -EFBIG in the case where we dont have enough space to write the full transition table. Also document in the ABI that this function can return -EFBIG error.",
