    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved io_uring/poll dont reissue in case of poll race on multishot request A previous commit fixed a poll race that can occur, but its only applicable for multishot requests. For a multishot request, we can safely ignore a spurious wakeup, as we never leave the waitqueue to begin with. A blunt reissue of a multishot armed request can cause us to leak a buffer, if they are ring provided. While this seems like a bug in itself, its not really defined behavior to reissue a multishot request directly. Its less efficient to do so as well, and not required to rearm anything like it is for singleshot poll requests.",
