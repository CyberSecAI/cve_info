    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media gspca cpia1 shift-out-of-bounds in set_flicker Syzkaller reported the following issue UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/media/usb/gspca/cpia1.c103127 shift exponent 245 is too large for 32-bit type int When the value of the variable sd->params.exposure.gain exceeds the number of bits in an integer, a shift-out-of-bounds error is reported. It is triggered because the variable currentexp cannot be left-shifted by more than the number of bits in an integer. In order to avoid invalid range during left-shift, the conditional expression is added.",
