    "description": "IEIT NF5280M6 UEFI firmware through 8.4 has a pool overflow vulnerability, caused by improper use of the gRT->GetVariable() function. Attackers with access to local NVRAM variables can exploit this by modifying these variables on SPI Flash, resulting in memory data being tampered with. When critical data in memory data is tampered with,a crash may occur.",
