    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nbd fix uaf in nbd_open Commit 4af5f2e03013 (nbd use blk_mq_alloc_disk and blk_cleanup_disk) cleans up disk by blk_cleanup_disk() and it wont set disk->private_data as NULL as before. UAF may be triggered in nbd_open() if someone tries to open nbd device right after nbd_put() since nbd has been free in nbd_dev_remove(). Fix this by implementing ->free_disk and free private data in it.",
