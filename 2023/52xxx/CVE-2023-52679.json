    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved of Fix double free in of_parse_phandle_with_args_map In of_parse_phandle_with_args_map() the inner loop that iterates through the map entries calls of_node_put(new) to free the reference acquired by the previous iteration of the inner loop. This assumes that the value of new is NULL on the first iteration of the inner loop. Make sure that this is true in all iterations of the outer loop by setting new to NULL after its value is assigned to cur. Extend the unittest to detect the double free and add an additional test case that actually triggers this path.",
