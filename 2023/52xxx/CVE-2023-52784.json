  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bonding stop the device in bond_setup_by_slave() Commit 9eed321cde22 (net lapbether only support ethernet devices) has been able to keep syzbot away from net/lapb, until today. In the following splat [1], the issue is that a lapbether device has been created on a bonding device without members. Then adding a non ARPHRD_ETHER member forced the bonding master to change its type. The fix is to make sure we call dev_close() in bond_setup_by_slave() so that the potential linked lapbether devices (or any other devices having assumptions on the physical device) are removed. A similar bug has been addressed in commit 40baec225765 (bonding fix panic on non-ARPHRD_ETHER enslave failure) [1] skbuff skb_under_panic textffff800089508810 len44 put40 headffff0000c78e7c00 dataffff0000c78e7bea tail0x16 end0x140 devbond0 kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c192 !
