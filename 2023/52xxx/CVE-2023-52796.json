    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ipvlan add ipvlan_route_v6_outbound() helper Inspired by syzbot reports using a stack of multiple ipvlan devices. Reduce stack size needed in ipvlan_process_v6_outbound() by moving the flowi6 struct used for the route lookup in an non inlined helper. ipvlan_route_v6_outbound() needs 120 bytes on the stack, immediately reclaimed. Also make sure ipvlan_process_v4_outbound() is not inlined. We might also have to lower MAX_NEST_DEV, because only syzbot uses setups with more than four stacked devices.
