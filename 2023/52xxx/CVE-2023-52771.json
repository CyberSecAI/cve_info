    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cxl/port Fix delete_endpoint() vs parent unregistration race The CXL subsystem, at cxl_mem ->probe() time, establishes a lineage of ports (struct cxl_port objects) between an endpoint and the root of a CXL topology. Each port including the endpoint port is attached to the cxl_port driver. Given that setup, it follows that when either any port in that lineage goes through a cxl_port ->remove() event, or the memdev goes through a cxl_mem ->remove() event. The hierarchy below the removed port, or the entire hierarchy if the memdev is removed needs to come down. The delete_endpoint() callback is careful to check whether it is being called to tear down the hierarchy, or if it is only being called to teardown the memdev because an ancestor port is going through ->remove(). That care needs to take the device_lock() of the endpoints parent. Which requires 2 bugs to be fixed 1/ A reference on the parent is needed to prevent use-after-free scenarios like this signature BUG spinlock bad magic on CPU#0, kworker/u560/11 Hardware name QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS edk2-20230524-3.fc38 05/24/2023 Workqueue cxl_port detach_memdev [cxl_core] RIP 0010spin_bug+0x65/0xa0 Call Trace do_raw_spin_lock+0x69/0xa0 __mutex_lock+0x695/0xb80 delete_endpoint+0xad/0x150 [cxl_core] devres_release_all+0xb8/0x110 device_unbind_cleanup+0xe/0x70 device_release_d",
