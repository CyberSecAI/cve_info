    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi ath9k Fix potential array-index-out-of-bounds read in ath9k_htc_txstatus() Fix an array-index-out-of-bounds read in ath9k_htc_txstatus(). The bug occurs when txs->cnt, data from a URB provided by a USB device, is bigger than the size of the array txs->txstatus, which is HTC_MAX_TX_STATUS. WARN_ON() already checks it, but there is no bug handling code after the check. Make the function return if that is the case. Found by a modified version of syzkaller.
