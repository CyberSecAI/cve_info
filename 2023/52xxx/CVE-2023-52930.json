  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/i915 Fix potential bit_17 double-free A userspace with multiple threads racing I915_GEM_SET_TILING to set the tiling to I915_TILING_NONE could trigger a double free of the bit_17 bitmask. (Or conversely leak memory on the transition to tiled.) Move allocation/freeing of the bitmask within the section protected by the obj lock.
