    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved phy lynx-28g serialize concurrent phy_set_mode_ext() calls to shared registers The protocol converter configuration registers PCC8, PCCC, PCCD (implemented by the driver), as well as others, control protocol converters from multiple lanes (each represented as a different struct phy). So, if there are simultaneous calls to phy_set_mode_ext() to lanes sharing the same PCC register (either for the old or for the new protocol), corruption of the values programmed to hardware is possible, because lynx_28g_rmw() has no locking. Add a spinlock in the struct lynx_28g_priv shared by all lanes, and take the global spinlock from the phy_ops set_mode() implementation. There are no other callers which modify PCC registers.",
