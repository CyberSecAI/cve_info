    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved fscache Use wait_on_bit() to wait for the freeing of relinquished volume The freeing of relinquished volume will wake up the pending volume acquisition by using wake_up_bit(), however it is mismatched with wait_var_event() used in fscache_wait_on_volume_collision() and it will never wake up the waiter in the wait-queue because these two functions operate on different wait-queues. According to the implementation in fscache_wait_on_volume_collision(), if the wake-up of pending acquisition is delayed longer than 20 seconds (e.g., due to the delay of on-demand fd closing), the first wait_var_event_timeout() will timeout and the following wait_var_event() will hang forever as shown below FS-Cache Potential volume collision new=00000024 old=00000022 ......

In addition because waitqueue_active() is used in wake_up_bit() and clear_bit() doesnt imply any memory barrier, use clear_and_wake_up_bit() to add the missing memory barrier between cursor->flags and waitqueue_active().",
