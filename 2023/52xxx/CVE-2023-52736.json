    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ALSA hda Do not unset preset when cleaning up codec Several functions that take part in codecs initialization and removal are re-used by ASoC codec drivers implementations. Drivers mimic the behavior of hda_codec_driver_probe/remove() found in sound/pci/hda/hda_bind.c with their component->probe/remove() instead. One of the reasons for that is the expectation of snd_hda_codec_device_new() to receive a valid pointer to an instance of struct snd_card. This expectation can be met only once sound card components probing commences. As ASoC sound card may be unbound without codec device being actually removed from the system, unsetting ->preset in snd_hda_codec_cleanup_for_unbind() interferes with module unload -> load scenario causing null-ptr-deref. Preset is assigned only once, during device/driver matching whereas ASoC codec drivers module reloading may occur several times throughout the lifetime of an audio stack.",
