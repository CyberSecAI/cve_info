    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ice Do not use WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag for workqueue When both ice and the irdma driver are loaded, a warning in check_flush_dependency is being triggered. This is due to ice driver workqueue being allocated with the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag and the irdma one is not. According to kernel documentation, this flag should be set if the workqueue will be involved in the kernels memory reclamation flow. Since it is not, there is no need for the ice drivers WQ to have this flag set so remove it.
