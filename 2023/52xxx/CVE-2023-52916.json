    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media aspeed Fix memory overwrite if timing is 1600x900 When capturing 1600x900, system could crash when system memory usage is tight. The way to reproduce this issue 1. Use 1600x900 to display on host 2. Mount ISO through Virtual media on OpenBMCs web 3. Run script as below on host to do sha continuously #!/bin/bash while [ [1] ] do find /media -type f -printf %h/%f\\n | xargs sha256sum done 4. Open KVM on OpenBMCs web The size of macro block captured is 8x8. Therefore, we should make sure the height of src-buf is 8 aligned to fix this issue.",
