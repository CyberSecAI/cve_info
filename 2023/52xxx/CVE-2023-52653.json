    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved SUNRPC fix a memleak in gss_import_v2_context The ctx->mech_used.data allocated by kmemdup is not freed in neither gss_import_v2_context nor it only caller gss_krb5_import_sec_context, which frees ctx on error. Thus, this patch reform the last call of gss_import_v2_context to the gss_krb5_import_ctx_v2, preventing the memleak while keepping the return formation.",
