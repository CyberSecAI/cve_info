    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net fix NULL pointer in skb_segment_list Commit 3a1296a38d0c (net Support GRO/GSO fraglist chaining.) introduced UDP listifyed GRO. The segmentation relies on frag_list being untouched when passing through the network stack. This assumption can be broken sometimes, where frag_list itself gets pulled into linear area, leaving frag_list being NULL. When this happens it can trigger following NULL pointer dereference, and panic the kernel. Reverse the test condition should fix it.",
