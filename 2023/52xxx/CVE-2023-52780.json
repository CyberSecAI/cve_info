  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net mvneta fix calls to page_pool_get_stats Calling page_pool_get_stats in the mvneta driver without checks leads to kernel crashes. First the page pool is only available if the bm is not used. The page pool is also not allocated when the port is stopped. It can also be not allocated in case of errors. The current implementation leads to the following crash calling ethstats on a port that is down or when calling it at the wrong moment ble to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000070 [00000070] *pgd=00000000 Internal error Oops 5 [#1] SMP ARM Hardware name Marvell Armada 380/385 (Device Tree) PC is at page_pool_get_stats+0x18/0x1cc LR is at mvneta_ethtool_get_stats+0xa0/0xe0 [mvneta] pc [] lr [] psr a0000013 sp f1439d48 ip f1439dc0 fp 0000001d r10 00000100 r9 c4816b80 r8 f0d75150 r7 bf0b400c r6 c238f000 r5 00000000 r4 f1439d68 r3 c2091040 r2 ffffffd8 r1 f1439d68 r0 00000000 Flags NzCv IRQs on FIQs on Mode SVC_32 ISA ARM Segment none Control 10c5387d Table 066b004a DAC 00000051 Register r0 information NULL pointer Register r1 information 2-page vmalloc region starting at 0xf1438000 allocated at kernel_clone+0x9c/0x390 Register r2 information non-paged memory Register r3 information slab kmalloc-2k start c2091000 pointer offset 64 size 2048 Register r4 information 2-page vmalloc region starting",
