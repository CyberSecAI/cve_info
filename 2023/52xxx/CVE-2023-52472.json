    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved crypto rsa - add a check for allocation failure Static checkers insist that the mpi_alloc() allocation can fail so add a check to prevent a NULL dereference. Small allocations like this cant actually fail in current kernels, but adding a check is very simple and makes the static checkers happy.",
