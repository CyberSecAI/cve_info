    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net nfc fix races in nfc_llcp_sock_get() and nfc_llcp_sock_get_sn() Sili Luo reported a race in nfc_llcp_sock_get(), leading to UAF. Getting a reference on the socket found in a lookup while holding a lock should happen before releasing the lock. nfc_llcp_sock_get_sn() has a similar problem. Finally nfc_llcp_recv_snl() needs to make sure the socket found by nfc_llcp_sock_from_sn() does not disappear.",
