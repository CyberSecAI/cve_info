    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media dvb-usb-v2 af9035 Fix null-ptr-deref in af9035_i2c_master_xfer In af9035_i2c_master_xfer, msg is controlled by user. When msg[i].buf is null and msg[i].len is zero, former checks on msg[i].buf would be passed. Malicious data finally reach af9035_i2c_master_xfer. If accessing msg[i].buf[0] without sanity check, null ptr deref would happen. We add check on msg[i].len to prevent crash. Similar commit commit 0ed554fd769a (media dvb-usb az6027 fix null-ptr-deref in az6027_i2c_xfer())",
