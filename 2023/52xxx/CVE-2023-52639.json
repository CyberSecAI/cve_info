    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM s390 vsie fix race during shadow creation Right now it is possible to see gmap->private being zero in kvm_s390_vsie_gmap_notifier resulting in a crash. This is due to the fact that we add gmap->private == kvm after creation static int acquire_gmap_shadow(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, struct vsie_page *vsie_page) { [...] gmap = gmap_shadow(vcpu->arch.gmap, asce, edat) if (IS_ERR(gmap)) return PTR_ERR(gmap) gmap->private = vcpu->kvm Let children inherit the private field of the parent.",
