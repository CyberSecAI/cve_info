    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved atl1c Work around the DMA RX overflow issue This is based on alx driver commit 881d0327db37 (net alx Work around the DMA RX overflow issue). The alx and atl1c drivers had RX overflow error which was why a custom allocator was created to avoid certain addresses. The simpler workaround then created for alx driver, but not for atl1c due to lack of tester. Instead of using a custom allocator, check the allocated skb address and use skb_reserve() to move away from problematic 0x...fc0 address. Tested on AR8131 on Acer 4540.",
