    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi wfx fix possible NULL pointer dereference in wfx_set_mfp_ap() Since ieee80211_beacon_get() can return NULL, wfx_set_mfp_ap() should check the return value before examining skb data. So convert the latter to return an appropriate error code and propagate it to return from wfx_start_ap() as well. Compile tested only.",
