    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net fix possible store tearing in neigh_periodic_work() While looking at a related syzbot report involving neigh_periodic_work(), I found that I forgot to add an annotation when deleting an RCU protected item from a list. Readers use rcu_deference(*np), we need to use either rcu_assign_pointer() or WRITE_ONCE() on writer side to prevent store tearing. I use rcu_assign_pointer() to have lockdep support, this was the choice made in neigh_flush_dev().",
