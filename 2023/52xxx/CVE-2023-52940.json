    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm multi-gen LRU fix crash during cgroup migration lru_gen_migrate_mm() assumes lru_gen_add_mm() runs prior to itself. This isnt true for the following scenario CPU 1 CPU 2 clone() cgroup_can_fork() cgroup_procs_write() cgroup_post_fork() task_lock() lru_gen_migrate_mm() task_unlock() task_lock() lru_gen_add_mm() task_unlock() And when the above happens, kernel crashes because of linked list corruption (mm_struct->lru_gen.list).",
