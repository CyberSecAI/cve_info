    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net can j1939 enhanced error handling for tightly received RTS messages in xtp_rx_rts_session_new This patch enhances error handling in scenarios with RTS (Request to Send) messages arriving closely. It replaces the less informative WARN_ON_ONCE backtraces with a new error handling method. This provides clearer error messages and allows for the early termination of problematic sessions. Previously, sessions were only released at the end of j1939_xtp_rx_rts(). Potentially this could be reproduced with something like testj1939 -r vcan00x80 & while true do # send first RTS cansend vcan0 18EC8090#1014000303002301 # send second RTS cansend vcan0 18EC8090#1014000303002301 # send abort cansend vcan0 18EC8090#ff00000000002301 done",
