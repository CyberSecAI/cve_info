    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/pm fix a double-free in si_dpm_init When the allocation of adev->pm.dpm.dyn_state.vddc_dependency_on_dispclk.entries fails, amdgpu_free_extended_power_table is called to free some fields of adev. However, when the control flow returns to si_dpm_sw_init, it goes to label dpm_failed and calls si_dpm_fini, which calls amdgpu_free_extended_power_table again and free those fields again. Thus a double-free is triggered.",
