    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved squashfs harden sanity check in squashfs_read_xattr_id_table While mounting a corrupted filesystem, a signed integer *xattr_ids can become less than zero. This leads to the incorrect computation of len and indexes values which can cause null-ptr-deref in copy_bio_to_actor() or out-of-bounds accesses in the next sanity checks inside squashfs_read_xattr_id_table(). Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.",
