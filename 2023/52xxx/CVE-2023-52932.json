    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/swapfile add cond_resched() in get_swap_pages() The softlockup still occurs in get_swap_pages() under memory pressure. 64 CPU cores, 64GB memory, and 28 zram devices, the disksize of each zram device is 50MB with same priority as si. Use the stress-ng tool to increase memory pressure, causing the system to oom frequently. The plist_for_each_entry_safe() loops in get_swap_pages() could reach tens of thousands of times to find available space (extreme case cond_resched() is not called in scan_swap_map_slots()). Lets add cond_resched() into get_swap_pages() when failed to find available space to avoid softlockup.",
