    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved fs/ntfs3 Fix an NULL dereference bug The issue here is when this is called from ntfs_load_attr_list(). The size comes from le32_to_cpu(attr->res.data_size) so it cant overflow on a 64bit systems but on 32bit systems the + 1023 can overflow and the result is zero. This means that the kmalloc will succeed by returning the ZERO_SIZE_PTR and then the memcpy() will crash with an Oops on the next line.",
