  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net phy dp83822 Fix null pointer access on DP83825/DP83826 devices The probe() function is only used for the DP83822 PHY, leaving the private data pointer uninitialized for the smaller DP83825/26 models. While all uses of the private data structure are hidden in 82822 specific callbacks, configuring the interrupt is shared across all models. This causes a NULL pointer dereference on the smaller PHYs as it accesses the private data unchecked. Verifying the pointer avoids that.",
