    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bus mhi host Add alignment check for event ring read pointer Though we do check the event ring read pointer by is_valid_ring_ptr to make sure it is in the buffer range, but there is another risk the pointer may be not aligned. Since we are expecting event ring elements are 128 bits(struct mhi_ring_element) aligned, an unaligned read pointer could lead to multiple issues like DoS or ring buffer memory corruption. So add a alignment check for event ring read pointer.",
