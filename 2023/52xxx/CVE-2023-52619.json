    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved pstore/ram Fix crash when setting number of cpus to an odd number When the number of cpu cores is adjusted to 7 or other odd numbers, the zone size will become an odd number. The address of the zone will become addr of zone0 = BASE addr of zone1 = BASE + zone_size addr of zone2 = BASE + zone_size*2 ... The address of zone1/3/5/7 will be mapped to non-alignment va. Eventually crashes will occur when accessing these va. So, use ALIGN_DOWN() to make sure the zone size is even to avoid this bug.",
