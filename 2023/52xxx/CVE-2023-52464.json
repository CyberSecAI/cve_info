Apparently the author of this driver expected strncat() to behave the way that strlcat() does, which uses the size of the destination buffer as its third argument rather than the length of the source buffer. The result is that there is no check on the size of the allocated buffer. Change it to strlcat(). [ bp Trim compiler output, fixup commit message. ]",
