    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi iscsi_tcp Fix UAF during login when accessing the shost ipaddress If during iscsi_sw_tcp_session_create() iscsi_tcp_r2tpool_alloc() fails, userspace could be accessing the hosts ipaddress attr. If we then free the session via iscsi_session_teardown() while userspace is still accessing the session we will hit a use after free bug. Set the tcp_sw_host->session after we have completed session creation and can no longer fail.",
