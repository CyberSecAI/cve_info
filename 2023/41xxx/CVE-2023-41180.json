    "description": "Incorrect certificate validation in InvokeHTTP on Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++ versions 0.13 to 0.14 allows an intermediary to present a forged certificate during TLS handshake negotation. The Disable Peer Verification property of InvokeHTTP was effectively flipped, disabling verification by default, when using HTTPS. Mitigation Set the Disable Peer Verification property of InvokeHTTP to true when using MiNiFi C++ versions 0.13.0 or 0.14.0. Upgrading to MiNiFi C++ 0.15.0 corrects the default behavior.",
