    "description": "ReportPortal is an AI-powered test automation platform. Prior to version 5.10.0 of the `com.epam.reportportalservice-api` module, corresponding to ReportPortal version 23.2, the ReportPortal database becomes unstable and reporting almost fully stops except for small launches with approximately 1 test inside when the test_item.path field is exceeded the allowable `ltree` field type indexing limit (path length>=120, approximately recursive nesting of the nested steps). REINDEX INDEX path_gist_idx and path_idx arent helped. The problem was fixed in `com.epam.reportportalservice-api` module version 5.10.0 (product release 23.2), where the maximum number of nested elements were programmatically limited. A workaround is available. After deletion of the data with long paths, and reindexing both indexes (path_gist_idx and path_idx), the database becomes stable and ReportPortal works properly.",
