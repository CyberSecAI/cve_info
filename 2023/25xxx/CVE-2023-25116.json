    "description": "Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the vtysh_ubus binary of Milesight UR32L v32.3.0.5 due to the use of an unsafe sprintf pattern. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker with high privileges can send HTTP requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.This buffer overflow occurs in the set_openvpn_client function with the local_virtual_ip and the remote_virtual_ip variables.",
