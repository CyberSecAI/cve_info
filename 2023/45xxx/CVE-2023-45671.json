    "description": "Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, there is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in any API endpoints reliant on the `/` base path as values provided for the path are not sanitized. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a users Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication) attacker knows the address of a users Frigate instance attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the users Frigate instance attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. As the reflected values included in the URL are not sanitized or escaped, this permits execution arbitrary Javascript payloads. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch for this issue.",
