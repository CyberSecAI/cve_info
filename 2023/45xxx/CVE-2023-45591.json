  "description": "A CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the logger_generic function of the Ax_rtu binary allows a remote authenticated attacker to trigger a memory corruption in the context of the binary. This may result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, possibly in the execution of arbitrary code with the same privileges of the process (root), or have other unspecified impacts on the device. This issue affects AiLux imx6 bundle below version imx6_1.0.7-2.",
