  "description": "An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when anapplication tries to check a malformed DSA public key by theEVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely leadto an application crash. This function can be called on publickeys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attackerto cause a denial of service attack.The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this functionbut applications might call the function if there are additionalsecurity requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.",
