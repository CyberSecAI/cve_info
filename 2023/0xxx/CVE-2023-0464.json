Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() function.",
