    "description": "An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when anapplication tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with thed2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions.The result of the dereference is an application crash which couldlead to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSLdoes not call this function however third party applications mightcall these functions on untrusted data.",
