    "description": "Copy_from_user on 64-bit versions of the Linux kernel does not implement the __uaccess_begin_nospec allowing a user to bypass the access_ok check and pass a kernel pointer to copy_from_user(). This would allow an attacker to leak information. We recommend upgrading beyond commit 74e19ef0ff8061ef55957c3abd71614ef0f42f47",
