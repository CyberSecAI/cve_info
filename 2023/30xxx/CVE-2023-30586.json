    "description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Node.js 20 that allowed loading arbitrary OpenSSL engines when the experimental permission model is enabled, which can bypass and/or disable the permission model. The attack complexity is high. However, the crypto.setEngine() API can be used to bypass the permission model when called with a compatible OpenSSL engine. The OpenSSL engine can, for example, disable the permission model in the host process by manipulating the processs stack memory to locate the permission model Permissionenabled_ in the host processs heap memory. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.",
