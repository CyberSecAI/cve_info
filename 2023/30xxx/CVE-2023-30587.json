    "description": "A vulnerability in Node.js version 20 allows for bypassing restrictions set by the --experimental-permission flag using the built-in inspector module (nodeinspector). By exploiting the Worker classs ability to create an internal worker with the kIsInternal Symbol, attackers can modify the isInternal value when an inspector is attached within the Worker constructor before initializing a new WorkerImpl. This vulnerability exclusively affects Node.js users employing the permission model mechanism. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.",
