  "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC STEP 7 Safety V18 (All versions < V18 Update 2). Affected applications do not properly restrict the .NET BinaryFormatter when deserializing user-controllable input. This could allow an attacker to cause a type confusion and execute arbitrary code within the affected application. This is the same issue that exists for .NET BinaryFormatter https//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/ca2300.",
