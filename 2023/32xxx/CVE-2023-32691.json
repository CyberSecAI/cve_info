    "description": "gost (GO Simple Tunnel) is a simple tunnel written in golang. Sensitive secrets such as passwords, token and API keys should be compared only using a constant-time comparison function. Untrusted input, sourced from a HTTP header, is compared directly with a secret. Since this comparison is not secure, an attacker can mount a side-channel timing attack to guess the password. As a workaround, this can be easily fixed using a constant time comparing function such as `crypto/subtle`s `ConstantTimeCompare`.",
