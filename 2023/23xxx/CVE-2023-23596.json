    "description": "jc21 NGINX Proxy Manager through 2.9.19 allows OS command injection. When creating an access list, the backend builds an htpasswd file with crafted username and/or password input that is concatenated without any validation, and is directly passed to the exec command, potentially allowing an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. NOTE this is not part of any NGINX software shipped by F5.",
