    "description": "An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability exists in curl <v7.88.0 based on the chained HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a server response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with differentalgorithms. The number of acceptable links in this decompression chain wascapped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a maliciousserver to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply byusing many headers. The use of such a decompression chain could result in a malloc bomb, making curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.",
