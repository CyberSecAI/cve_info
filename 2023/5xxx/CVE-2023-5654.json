    "description": "The React Developer Tools extension registers a message listener with window.addEventListener(message, ) in a content script that is accessible to any webpage that is active in the browser. Within the listener is code that requests a URL derived from the received message via fetch(). The URL is not validated or sanitised before it is fetched, thus allowing a malicious web page to arbitrarily fetch URLs via the victims browser.",
