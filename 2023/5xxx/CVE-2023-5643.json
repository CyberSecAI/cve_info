    "description": "Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in Arm Ltd Bifrost GPU Kernel Driver, Arm Ltd Valhall GPU Kernel Driver, Arm Ltd Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Kernel Driver allows alocal non-privileged user to make improper GPU memory processing operations. Depending on the configuration of the Mali GPU Kernel Driver, and if the systems memory is carefully prepared by the user, then this in turn could write to memory outside of buffer bounds.This issue affects Bifrost GPU Kernel Driver from r41p0 through r45p0 Valhall GPU Kernel Driver from r41p0 through r45p0 Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Kernel Driver from r41p0 through r45p0.",
