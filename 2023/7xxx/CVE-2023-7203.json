    "description": "The Smart Forms WordPress plugin before 2.6.87 does not have authorisation in various AJAX actions, which could allow users with a role as low as subscriber to call them and perform unauthorised actions such as deleting entries. The plugin also lacks CSRF checks in some places which could allow attackers to make logged in users perform unwanted actions via CSRF attacks such as deleting entries.",
