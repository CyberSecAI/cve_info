    "description": "An issue was discovered in SoftMaker Office 2024 / NX before revision 1214 and SoftMaker FreeOffice 2014 before revision 1215. FreeOffice 2021 is also affected, but wont be fixed. The SoftMaker Office and FreeOffice MSI installer files were found to produce a visible conhost.exe window running as the SYSTEM user when using the repair function of msiexec.exe. This allows a local, low-privileged attacker to use a chain of actions, to open a fully functional cmd.exe with the privileges of the SYSTEM user.",
