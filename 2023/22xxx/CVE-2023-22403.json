    "description": "An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).On QFX10K Series, Inter-Chassis Control Protocol (ICCP) is used in MC-LAG topologies to exchange control information between the devices in the topology. ICCP connection flaps and sync issues will be observed due to excessive specific traffic to the local device.This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX10K Series * All versions prior to 20.2R3-S7 * 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4 * 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S3 * 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S1 * 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3 * 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3 * 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2.",
