  "description": "A Use After Free vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). In a Non Stop Routing (NSR) scenario, an unexpected kernel restart might be observed if bgp auto-discovery is enabled and if there is a BGP neighbor flap of auto-discovery sessions for any reason. This is a race condition which is outside of an attackers direct control and it depends on system internal timing whether this issue occurs. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-EVO 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-EVO 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2-EVO 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R1-S1-EVO, 22.2R2-EVO.",
