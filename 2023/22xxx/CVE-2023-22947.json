    "description": "Insecure folder permissions in the Windows installation path of Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) before 3.4.1 allow an unprivileged local attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM via DLL planting in the service executables folder. This occurs because the installation goes under C\\opt (rather than C\\Program Files) by default. NOTE the vendor disputes the significance of this report, stating that We consider the ACLs a best effort thing and it was a documentation mistake.",
