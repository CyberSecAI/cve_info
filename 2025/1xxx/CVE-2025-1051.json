    "description": "Sonos Era 300 Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Sonos Era 300 speakers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of ALAC data. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the anacapa user. Was ZDI-CAN-25865.",
