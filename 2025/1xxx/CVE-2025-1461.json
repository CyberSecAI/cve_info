    "description": "Improper neutralization of the value of the eventMoreText property of the VCalendar component in Vuetify allows unsanitized HTML to be inserted into the page. This can lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) https//owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss attack. The vulnerability occurs because the default Vuetify translator will return the translation key as the translation, if it cant find an actual translation. This issue affects Vuetify versions greater than or equal to 2.0.0 and less than 3.0.0. Note Version 2.x of Vuetify is End-of-Life and will not receive any updates to address this issue. For more information see here https//v2.vuetifyjs.com/en/about/eol/ .",
