  "description": "There is a SQL injection issue in Esri ArcGIS Monitor versions 2023.0 through 2024.x on Windows and Linux that allows a remote, authenticated attacker with low privileges to improperly read limited database schema information by passing crafted queries. While it is possible to enumerate some internal database identifiers, the impact to the confidentiality vector is LOW because any sensitive data returned in a response is encrypted. There is no evidence of impact to the integrity or availability vectors. This issue is addressed in ArcGIS Monitor 2024.1.",
