    "description": "Concrete CMS version 9 below 9.4.0RC2 and versions below 8.5.20 are vulnerable to CSRF and XSS in the Concrete CMS Address attribute because addresses are not properly sanitized in the output when a country is not specified. Attackers are limited to individuals whom a site administrator has granted the ability to fill in an address attribute. It is possible for the attacker to glean limited information from the site but amount and type is restricted by mitigating controls and the level of access of the attacker. Limited data modification is possible. The dashboard page itself could be rendered unavailable. The fix only sanitizes new data uploaded post update to Concrete CMS 9.4.0RC2. Existing database entries added before the update will still be live if there were successful exploits added under previous versions a database search is recommended. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability CVSS v.4.0 score of 5.1 with vector CVSS4.0/AVN/ACL/ATN/PRL/UIP/VCL/VIL/VAL/SCL/SIL/SAL Thanks Myq Larson for reporting.",
