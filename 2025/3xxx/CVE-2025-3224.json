    "description": "A vulnerability in the update process of Docker Desktop for Windows versions prior to 4.41.0 could allow a local, low-privileged attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. During an update, Docker Desktop attempts to delete files and subdirectories under the path C\\\\ProgramData\\\\Docker\\\\config with high privileges. However, this directory often does not exist by default, and C\\\\ProgramData\\\\ allows normal users to create new directories. By creating a malicious Docker\\\\config folder structure at this location, an attacker can force the privileged update process to delete or manipulate arbitrary system files, leading to Elevation of Privilege.",
