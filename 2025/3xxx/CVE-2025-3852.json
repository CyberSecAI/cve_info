    "description": "The WPshop 2 E-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in versions 2.0.0 to 2.6.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a users identity prior to updating their details like email & password through the update() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary users passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.",
