    "description": "The Job Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to improper authorization within the register_action() function in versions 0.1 to 0.1.1. The plugins registration handler reads the client-supplied $_POST[user_role] and passes it directly to wp_insert_user() without restricting to a safe set of roles. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.",
