  "description": "eCharge Hardy Barth cPH2 index.php Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of eCharge Hardy Barth cPH2 charging stations. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of GET parameters provided to the index.php endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the www-data user. Was ZDI-CAN-23115.",
