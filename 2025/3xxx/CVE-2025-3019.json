This can lead to information loss and/or modification of existing data. The issues are caused by a bug https//github.com/Baroshem/nuxt-security/issues/610 in the widely used nuxt-security module. There are no viable workarounds therefore we strongly recommend to update to one of the following versions of KNIME Business Hub * 1.13.3 or later * 1.12.4 or later",
