    "description": "An arbitrary write vulnerability in Microsoft signed UEFI firmware allows for code execution of untrusted software. This allows an attacker to control its value, leading to arbitrary memory writes, including modification of critical firmware settings stored in NVRAM. Exploiting this vulnerability could enable security bypasses, persistence mechanisms, or full system compromise.",
