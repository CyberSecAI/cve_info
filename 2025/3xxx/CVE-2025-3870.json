    "description": "The 1 Decembrie 1918 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.dec.2012. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 1-decembrie-1918/1-decembrie-1918.php page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
