    "description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Starting in version 1.41.3 and prior to versions 2.1.13, 2.2.13, and 2.3.2, `deno run --allow-read --deny-read main.ts` results in allowed, even though deny should be stronger. The result is the same with all global unary permissions given as `--allow-* --deny-*`. This only affects a nonsensical combination of flags, so there shouldnt be a real impact on the userbase. Users may upgrade to version 2.1.13, 2.2.13, or 2.3.2 to receive a patch.",
