    "description": "PowSyBl (Power System Blocks) is a framework to build power system oriented software. In com.powsyblpowsybl-iidm-criteria versions 6.3.0 to before 6.7.2 and com.powsyblpowsybl-contingency-api versions 5.0.0 to before 6.3.0, there is a a potential polynomial Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the RegexCriterion class. This class compiles and evaluates an unvalidated, user-supplied regular expression against the identifier of an Identifiable object via Pattern.compile(regex).matcher(id).find(). If successfully exploited, a malicious actor can cause significant CPU exhaustion through repeated or recursive filter(...) calls especially if performed over large network models or filtering operations. This issue has been patched in com.powsyblpowsybl-iidm-criteria 6.7.2.",
