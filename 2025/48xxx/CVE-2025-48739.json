    "description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in StrangeBee TheHive 5.2.0 before 5.2.16, 5.3.0 before 5.3.11, 5.4.0 before 5.4.10, and 5.5.0 before 5.5.1 allows remote authenticated attackers with admin permissions (allowing them to access specific API endpoints) to manipulate URLs to direct requests to unexpected hosts or ports. This allows the attacker to use a TheHive server as a proxy to reach internal or otherwise restricted resources. This could be exploited to access other servers on the internal network.",
