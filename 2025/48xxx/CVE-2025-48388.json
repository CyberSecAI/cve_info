    "description": "FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.178, the application performs insufficient validation of user-supplied data, which is used as arguments to string formatting functions. As a result, an attacker can pass a string containing special symbols (\\\\r, \\\\n, \\\\t)to the application. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.178.",
