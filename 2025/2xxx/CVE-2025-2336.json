    "description": "Improper sanitization of the value of the href and xlinkhref attributes in SVG elements in AngularJSs ngSanitize module allows attackers to bypass common image source restrictions. This can lead to a form of Content Spoofing https//owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Content_Spoofing and also negatively affect the applications performance and behavior by using too large or slow-to-load images. This issue affects AngularJS versions greater than or equal to 1.3.1. Note The AngularJS project is End-of-Life and will not receive any updates to address this issue.
