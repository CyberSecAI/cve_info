    "description": "The Ninja Tables Easy Data Table Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.18 via deserialization of untrusted input from the args[callback] parameter . This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to execute arbitrary functions, though it does not allow user supplied parameters only single functions can be called so the impact is limited.",
