    "description": "The Streamit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a users identity prior to updating their details like email in the st_Authentication_Controlleredit_profile function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary users email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the users password and gain access to their account.",
