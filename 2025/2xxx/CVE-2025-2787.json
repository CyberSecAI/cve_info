    "description": "KNIME Business Hub is affected by the Ingress-nginx CVE-2025-1974 ( a.k.a IngressNightmare ) vulnerability which affects the ingress-nginx component. In the worst case a complete takeover of the Kubernetes cluster is possible. Since the affected component is only reachable from within the cluster, i.e. requires an authenticated user, the severity in the context of KNIME Business Hub is slightly lower. Besides applying the publicly known workarounds, we strongly recommend updating to one of the following versions of KNIME Business Hub * 1.13.3 or above * 1.12.4 or above * 1.11.4 or above * 1.10.4 or above *",
