    "description": "A hard-coded, non-random password for the object store (minio) of KNIME Business Hub in all versions except the ones listed below allows an unauthenticated remote attacker in possession of the password to read and manipulate swapped jobs or read and manipulate in- and output data of active jobs. It is also possible to cause a denial-of-service of most functionality of KNIME Business Hub by writing large amounts of data to the object store directly. There are no viable workarounds therefore we strongly recommend to update to one of the following versions of KNIME Business Hub * 1.13.2 or later * 1.12.3 or later * 1.11.3 or later * 1.10.3 or later",
