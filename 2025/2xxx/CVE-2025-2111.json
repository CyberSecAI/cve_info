    "description": "The Insert Headers And Footers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the custom_plugin_set_option function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. The WPBRIGADE_SDK__DEV_MODE constant must be set to true to exploit the vulnerability.",
