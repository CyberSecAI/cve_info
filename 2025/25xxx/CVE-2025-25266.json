  "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2302 (All versions < V2302.0021), Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2404 (All versions < V2404.0010). The affected application does not properly restrict access to the file deletion functionality. This could allow an unauthorized attacker to delete files even when access to the system should be prohibited, resulting in potential data loss or unauthorized modification of system files.",
