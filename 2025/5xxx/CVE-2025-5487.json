    "description": "The AutomatorWP Automator plugin for no-code automations, webhooks & custom integrations in WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the field_conditions parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. Administrators can configure the plugin to allow access to this functionality to authors and higher.",
