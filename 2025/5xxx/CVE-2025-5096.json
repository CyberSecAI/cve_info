    "description": "The TablePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the data-caption, data-s-content-padding, data-s-title, and data-footer data-attributes in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
