  "description": "WOLFBOX Level 2 EV Charger LAN OTA Exposed Dangerous Method Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of WOLFBOX Level 2 EV Charger. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the Tuya communications module software. The issue results from the exposure of a method allowing the upload of crafted software images to the module. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.
