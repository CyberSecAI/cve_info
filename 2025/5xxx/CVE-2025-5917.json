    "timestamp": "2025-07-04T16:12:41.853043+00:00",
    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in the libarchive library. This flaw involves an off-by-one miscalculation when handling prefixes and suffixes for file names. This can lead to a 1-byte write overflow. While seemingly small, such an overflow can corrupt adjacent memory, leading to unpredictable program behavior, crashes, or in specific circumstances, could be leveraged as a building block for more sophisticated exploitation.",
