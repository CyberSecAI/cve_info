  "description": "The Simple History plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive data exposure via Detective Mode due to improper sanitization within the append_debug_info_to_context() function in versions prior to 5.8.1. When Detective Mode is enabled, the plugins logger captures the entire contents of $_POST (and sometimes raw request bodies or $_GET) without redacting any passwordrelated keys. As a result, whenever a user submits a login form, whether via native wp_login or a thirdparty login widget, their actual password is written in clear text into the logs. An authenticated attacker or any user whose actions generate a login event will have their password recorded an administrator (or anyone with database read access) can then read those logs and retrieve every captured password.",
