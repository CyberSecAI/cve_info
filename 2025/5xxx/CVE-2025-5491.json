    "description": "Acer ControlCenter contains Remote Code Execution vulnerability. The program exposes a Windows Named Pipe that uses a custom protocol to invoke internal functions. However, this Named Pipe is misconfigured, allowing remote users with low privileges to interact with it and access its features. One such feature enables the execution of arbitrary programs as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM. By leveraging this, remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the target system with elevated privileges.",
