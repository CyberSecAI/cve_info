This is due to incorrect authentication checking in the IS_BA_Browse_Asnotice function with the is_ba_original_user_COOKIEHASH cookie value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user id.",
