    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in the libarchive library, specifically within the archive_read_format_rar_seek_data() function. This flaw involves an integer overflow that can ultimately lead to a double-free condition. Exploiting a double-free vulnerability can result in memory corruption, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.",
