    "description": "The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the set_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in default configurations where the the default password is left as 11, or where the attacker gains access to the credentials.",
