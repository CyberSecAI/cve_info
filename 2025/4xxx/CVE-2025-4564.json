  "description": "The TicketBAI Facturas para WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation via the delpdf action in all versions up to, and including, 3.18. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).",
