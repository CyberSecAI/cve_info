    "description": "The NEX-Forms Ultimate Form Builder Contact forms and much more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 8.9.1 via the get_table_records function. This is due to the unsanitized use of user-supplied input in call_user_func(). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Custom-level access, to execute arbitrary PHP functions that meet specific constraints (static methods or global functions accepting a single array parameter).",
