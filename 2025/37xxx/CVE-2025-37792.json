  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Bluetooth btrtl Prevent potential NULL dereference The btrtl_initialize() function checks that rtl_load_file() either had an error or it loaded a zero length file. However, if it loaded a zero length file then the error code is not set correctly. It results in an error pointer vs NULL bug, followed by a NULL pointer dereference.
