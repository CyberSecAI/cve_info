    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ftrace Add cond_resched() to ftrace_graph_set_hash() When the kernel contains a large number of functions that can be traced, the loop in ftrace_graph_set_hash() may take a lot of time to execute. This may trigger the softlockup watchdog. Add cond_resched() within the loop to allow the kernel to remain responsive even when processing a large number of functions. This matches the cond_resched() that is used in other locations of the code that iterates over all functions that can be traced.",
