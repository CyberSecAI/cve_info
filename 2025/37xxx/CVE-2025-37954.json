    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved smb client Avoid race in open_cached_dir with lease breaks A pre-existing valid cfid returned from find_or_create_cached_dir might race with a lease break, meaning open_cached_dir doesnt consider it valid, and thinks its newly-constructed. This leaks a dentry reference if the allocation occurs before the queued lease break work runs. Avoid the race by extending holding the cfid_list_lock across find_or_create_cached_dir and when the result is checked.",
