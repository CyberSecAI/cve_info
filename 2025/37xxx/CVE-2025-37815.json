    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved misc microchip pci1xxxx Fix Kernel panic during IRQ handler registration Resolve kernel panic while accessing IRQ handler associated with the generated IRQ. This is done by acquiring the spinlock and storing the current interrupt state before handling the interrupt request using generic_handle_irq. A previous fix patch was submitted where generic_handle_irq was replaced with handle_nested_irq. However, this change also causes the kernel panic where after determining which GPIO triggered the interrupt and attempting to call handle_nested_irq with the mapped IRQ number, leads to a failure in locating the registered handler.",
