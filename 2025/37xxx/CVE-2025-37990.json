    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi brcm80211 fmac Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage() The function brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage() calls the function brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() but dose not check its return value. The state.state and the state.bytes are uninitialized if the function brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails. It is dangerous to use uninitialized variables in the conditions. Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() to jump to error handling path if the brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails and the state.state and the state.bytes are uninitialized. Improve the error message to report more detailed error information.",
