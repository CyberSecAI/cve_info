    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Fix invalid context error in dml helper [Why] BUG sleeping function called from invalid context error. after drm/amd/display Protect FPU in dml2_validate()/dml21_validate() The populate_dml_plane_cfg_from_plane_state() uses the GFP_KERNEL flag for memory allocation, which shouldnt be used in atomic contexts. The allocation is needed only for using another helper function get_scaler_data_for_plane(). [How] Modify helpers to pass a pointer to scaler_data within existing context, eliminating the need for dynamic memory allocation/deallocation and copying.
