    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net_sched sch_sfq move the limit validation It is not sufficient to directly validate the limit on the data that the user passes as it can be updated based on how the other parameters are changed. Move the check at the end of the configuration update process to also catch scenarios where the limit is indirectly updated, for example with the following configurations tc qdisc add dev dummy0 handle 1 root sfq limit 2 flows 1 depth 1 tc qdisc add dev dummy0 handle 1 root sfq limit 2 flows 1 divisor 1 This fixes the following syzkaller reported crash ------------[ cut here ]------------ UBSAN array-index-out-of-bounds in net/sched/sch_sfq.c2036 index 65535 is out of range for type struct sfq_head[128] CPU 1 UID 0 PID 3037 Comm syz.2.16 Not tainted 6.14.0-rc2-syzkaller #0 Hardware name Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 12/27/2024 Call Trace __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c94 [inline] dump_stack_lvl+0x201/0x300 lib/dump_stack.c120 ubsan_epilogue lib/ubsan.c231 [inline] __ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds+0xf5/0x120 lib/ubsan.c429 sfq_link net/sched/sch_sfq.c203 [inline] sfq_dec+0x53c/0x610 net/sched/sch_sfq.c231 sfq_dequeue+0x34e/0x8c0 net/sched/sch_sfq.c493 sfq_reset+0x17/0x60 net/sched/sch_sfq.c518 qdisc_reset+0x12e/0x600 net/sched/sch_generic.c1035 tbf_reset+0x41/0x110 net/sched/sch_tbf.c339 qdisc_reset+0x12e/0x600 net/sched/sch_generic.c1035 dev_reset_queue+0x100/0x1b0 net/sched/sch_generic.c1311 netdev_for_each_tx_queue include/linux/netdevice.h2590 [inline] dev_deactivate_many+0x7e5/0xe70 net/sched/sch_generic.c1375",
