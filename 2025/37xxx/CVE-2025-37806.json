  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved fs/ntfs3 Keep write operations atomic syzbot reported a NULL pointer dereference in __generic_file_write_iter. [1] Before the write operation is completed, the user executes ioctl[2] to clear the compress flag of the file, which causes the is_compressed() judgment to return 0, further causing the program to enter the wrong process and call the wrong ops ntfs_aops_cmpr, which triggers the null pointer dereference of write_begin. Use inode lock to synchronize ioctl and write to avoid this case.
