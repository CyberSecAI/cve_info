    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tipc fix memory leak in tipc_link_xmit In case the backlog transmit queue for system-importance messages is overloaded, tipc_link_xmit() returns -ENOBUFS but the skb list is not purged. This leads to memory leak and failure when a skb is allocated. This commit fixes this issue by purging the skb list before tipc_link_xmit() returns.",
