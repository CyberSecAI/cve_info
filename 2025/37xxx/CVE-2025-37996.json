    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM arm64 Fix uninitialized memcache pointer in user_mem_abort() Commit fce886a60207 (KVM arm64 Plumb the pKVM MMU in KVM) made the initialization of the local memcache variable in user_mem_abort() conditional, leaving a codepath where it is used uninitialized via kvm_pgtable_stage2_map(). This can fail on any path that requires a stage-2 allocation without transition via a permission fault or dirty logging. Fix this by making sure that memcache is always valid.",
