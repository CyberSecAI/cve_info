    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ksmbd fix WARNING do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING wait_event_timeout() will set the state of the current task to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, before doing the condition check. This means that ksmbd_durable_scavenger_alive() will try to acquire the mutex while already in a sleeping state. The scheduler warns us by giving the following warning do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING state=2 set at [] prepare_to_wait_event+0x9f/0x6c0 WARNING CPU 2 PID 4147 at kernel/sched/core.c10099 __might_sleep+0x12f/0x160 mutex lock is not needed in ksmbd_durable_scavenger_alive().",
