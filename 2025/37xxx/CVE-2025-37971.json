    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved staging bcm2835-camera Initialise dev in v4l2_dev Commit 42a2f6664e18 (staging vc04_services Move global g_state to vchiq_state) changed mmal_init to pass dev->v4l2_dev.dev to vchiq_mmal_init, however nothing iniitialised dev->v4l2_dev, so we got a NULL pointer dereference. Set dev->v4l2_dev.dev during bcm2835_mmal_probe. The device pointer could be passed into v4l2_device_register to set it, however that also has other effects that would need additional changes.",
