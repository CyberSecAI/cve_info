  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net ngbe fix memory leak in ngbe_probe() error path When ngbe_sw_init() is called, memory is allocated for wx->rss_key in wx_init_rss_key(). However, in ngbe_probe() function, the subsequent error paths after ngbe_sw_init() dont free the rss_key. Fix that by freeing it in error path along with wx->mac_table. Also change the label to which execution jumps when ngbe_sw_init() fails, because otherwise, it could lead to a double free for rss_key, when the mac_table allocation fails in wx_sw_init().",
