    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/i915/huc Fix fence not released on early probe errors HuC delayed loading fence, introduced with commit 27536e03271da (drm/i915/huc track delayed HuC load with a fence), is registered with object tracker early on driver probe but unregistered only from driver remove, which is not called on early probe errors. Since its memory is allocated under devres, then released anyway, it may happen to be allocated again to the fence and reused on future driver probes, resulting in kernel warnings that taint the kernel",
