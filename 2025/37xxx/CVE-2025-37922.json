    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved book3s64/radix Align section vmemmap start address to PAGE_SIZE A vmemmap altmap is a device-provided region used to provide backing storage for struct pages. For each namespace, the altmap should belong to that same namespace. If the namespaces are created unaligned, there is a chance that the section vmemmap start address could also be unaligned. If the section vmemmap start address is unaligned, the altmap page allocated from the current namespace might be used by the previous namespace also. During the free operation, since the altmap is shared between two namespaces, the previous namespace may detect that the page does not belong to its altmap and incorrectly assume that the page is a normal page. It then attempts to free the normal page, which leads to a kernel crash. Kernel attempted to read user page (18) - exploit attempt? (uid 0) BUG Kernel NULL pointer dereference on read at 0x00000018 Faulting instruction address 0xc000000000530c7c Oops Kernel access of bad area, sig 11",
