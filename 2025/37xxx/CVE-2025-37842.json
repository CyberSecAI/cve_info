    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved spi fsl-qspi use devm function instead of driver remove Driver use devm APIs to manage clk/irq/resources and register the spi controller, but the legacy remove function will be called first during device detach and trigger kernel panic. Drop the remove function and use devm_add_action_or_reset() for driver cleanup to ensure the release sequence. Trigger kernel panic on i.MX8MQ by echo 30bb0000.spi >/sys/bus/platform/drivers/fsl-quadspi/unbind",
