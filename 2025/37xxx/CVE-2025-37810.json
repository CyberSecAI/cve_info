    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb dwc3 gadget check that event count does not exceed event buffer length The event count is read from register DWC3_GEVNTCOUNT. There is a check for the count being zero, but not for exceeding the event buffer length. Check that event count does not exceed event buffer length, avoiding an out-of-bounds access when memcpying the event.
