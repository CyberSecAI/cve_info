    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bnxt_en Fix error handling path in bnxt_init_chip() WARN_ON() is triggered in __flush_work() if bnxt_init_chip() fails because we call cancel_work_sync() on dim work that has not been initialized. WARNING CPU 37 PID 5223 at kernel/workqueue.c4201 __flush_work.isra.0+0x212/0x230 The driver relies on the BNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED bit to check if dim work has already been cancelled. But in the bnxt_open() path, BNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED is not set and this causes the error path to think that it needs to cancel the uninitalized dim work. Fix it by setting BNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED during initialization. The bit will be cleared when we enable NAPI and initialize dim work.",
