    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved spi spi-mem Add fix to avoid divide error For some SPI flash memory operations, dummy bytes are not mandatory. For example, in Winbond SPINAND flash memory devices, the `write_cache` and `update_cache` operation variants have zero dummy bytes. Calculating the duration for SPI memory operations with zero dummy bytes causes a divide error when `ncycles` is calculated in the spi_mem_calc_op_duration(). Add changes to skip the ncylcles calculation for zero dummy bytes. Following divide error is fixed by this change Oops divide error 0000",
