    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi ath12k Fix invalid entry fetch in ath12k_dp_mon_srng_process Currently, ath12k_dp_mon_srng_process uses ath12k_hal_srng_src_get_next_entry to fetch the next entry from the destination ring. This is incorrect because ath12k_hal_srng_src_get_next_entry is intended for source rings, not destination rings. This leads to invalid entry fetches, causing potential data corruption or crashes due to accessing incorrect memory locations. This happens because the source ring and destination ring have different handling mechanisms and using the wrong function results in incorrect pointer arithmetic and ring management. To fix this issue, replace the call to ath12k_hal_srng_src_get_next_entry with ath12k_hal_srng_dst_get_next_entry in ath12k_dp_mon_srng_process. This ensures that the correct function is used for fetching entries from the destination ring, preventing invalid memory accesses.
