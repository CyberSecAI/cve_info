    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ovl dont allow datadir only In theory overlayfs could support upper layer directly referring to a data layer, but theres no current use case for this. Originally, when data-only layers were introduced, this wasnt allowed, only introduced by the datadir+ feature, but without actually handling this case, resulting in an Oops. Fix by disallowing datadir without lowerdir.",
