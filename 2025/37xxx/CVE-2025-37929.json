    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved arm64 errata Add missing sentinels to Spectre-BHB MIDR arrays Commit a5951389e58d (arm64 errata Add newer ARM cores to the spectre_bhb_loop_affected() lists) added some additional CPUs to the Spectre-BHB workaround, including some new arrays for designs that require new k values for the workaround to be effective. Unfortunately, the new arrays omitted the sentinel entry and so is_midr_in_range_list() will walk off the end when it doesnt find a match. With UBSAN enabled, this leads to a crash during boot when is_midr_in_range_list() is inlined (which was more common prior to c8c2647e69be (arm64 Make _midr_in_range_list() an exported function)) | Internal error aarch64 BRK 00000000f2000001",
