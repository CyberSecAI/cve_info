    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cpufreq scmi Fix null-ptr-deref in scmi_cpufreq_get_rate() cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() can return NULL when the target CPU is not present in the policy->cpus mask. scmi_cpufreq_get_rate() does not check for this case, which results in a NULL pointer dereference. Add NULL check after cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() to prevent this issue.",
