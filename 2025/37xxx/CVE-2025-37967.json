    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb typec ucsi displayport Fix deadlock This patch introduces the ucsi_con_mutex_lock / ucsi_con_mutex_unlock functions to the UCSI driver. ucsi_con_mutex_lock ensures the connector mutex is only locked if a connection is established and the partner pointer is valid. This resolves a deadlock scenario where ucsi_displayport_remove_partner holds con->mutex waiting for dp_altmode_work to complete while dp_altmode_work attempts to acquire it.",
