    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/msm/dpu Fix error pointers in dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check The function dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check was dereferencing pointers returned by drm_atomic_get_plane_state without checking for errors. This could lead to undefined behavior if the function returns an error pointer. This commit adds checks using IS_ERR to ensure that plane_state is valid before dereferencing them. Similar to commit da29abe71e16 (drm/amd/display Fix error pointers in amdgpu_dm_crtc_mem_type_changed). Patchwork https//patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/643132/",
