    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved perf/dwc_pcie fix duplicate pci_dev devices During platform_device_register, wrongly using struct device pci_dev as platform_data caused a kmemdup copy of pci_dev. Worse still, accessing the duplicated device leads to list corruption as its mutex content (e.g., list, magic) remains the same as the original.",
