    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi ath12k Fix invalid data access in ath12k_dp_rx_h_undecap_nwifi In certain cases, hardware might provide packets with a length greater than the maximum native Wi-Fi header length. This can lead to accessing and modifying fields in the header within the ath12k_dp_rx_h_undecap_nwifi function for DP_RX_DECAP_TYPE_NATIVE_WIFI decap type and potentially resulting in invalid data access and memory corruption. Add a sanity check before processing the SKB to prevent invalid data access in the undecap native Wi-Fi function for the DP_RX_DECAP_TYPE_NATIVE_WIFI decap type.
