  "description": "An unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability exists in the applyCT component of the Hikvision Integrated Security Management Platform due to the use of a vulnerable version of the Fastjson library. The endpoint /bic/ssoService/v1/applyCT deserializes untrusted user input, allowing an attacker to trigger Fastjsons auto-type feature to load arbitrary Java classes. By referencing a malicious class via an LDAP URL, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the underlying system.",
