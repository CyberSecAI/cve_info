    "description": "A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in multiple Selea Targa IP OCR-ANPR camera models, including iZero, Targa 512, Targa 504, Targa Semplice, Targa 704 TKM, Targa 805, Targa 710 INOX, Targa 750, and Targa 704 ILB. The application fails to validate user-supplied input in JSON POST parameters such as ipnotify_address and url, which are used by internal mechanisms to perform image fetch and DNS lookups. This allows remote unauthenticated attackers to induce the system to make arbitrary HTTP requests to internal or external systems, potentially bypassing firewall policies or conducting internal service enumeration.",
