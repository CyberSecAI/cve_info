    "description": "Hikvision Streaming Media Management Server v2.3.5 uses default credentials that allow remote attackers to authenticate and access restricted functionality. After authenticating with these credentials, an attacker can exploit an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the /systemLog/downFile.php endpoint via directory traversal in the fileName parameter. This exploit chain can enable unauthorized access to sensitive system files.",
