    "description": "sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust. Prior to version 0.2.6, users with limited sudo privileges (e.g. execution of a single command) can list sudo privileges of other users using the `-U` flag. This vulnerability allows users with limited sudo privileges to enumerate the sudoers file, revealing sensitive information about other users permissions. Attackers can collect information that can be used to more targeted attacks. Systems where users either do not have sudo privileges or have the ability to run all commands as root through sudo (the default configuration on most systems) are not affected by this advisory. Version 0.2.6 fixes the vulnerability.",
