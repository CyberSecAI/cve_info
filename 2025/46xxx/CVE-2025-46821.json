    "description": "Envoy is a cloud-native edge/middle/service proxy. Prior to versions 1.34.1, 1.33.3, 1.32.6, and 1.31.8, Envoys URI template matcher incorrectly excludes the `*` character from a set of valid characters in the URI path. As a result URI path containing the `*` character will not match a URI template expressions. This can result in bypass of RBAC rules when configured using the `uri_template` permissions. This vulnerability is fixed in Envoy versions v1.34.1, v1.33.3, v1.32.6, v1.31.8. As a workaround, configure additional RBAC permissions using `url_path` with `safe_regex` expression.",
