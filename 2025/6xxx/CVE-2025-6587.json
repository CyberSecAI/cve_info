    "description": "System environment variables are recorded in Docker Desktop diagnostic logs, when using shell auto-completion. This leads to unintentional disclosure of sensitive information such as api keys, passwords, etc. A malicious actor with read access to these logs could obtain secrets and further use them to gain unauthorized access to other systems. Starting with version 4.43.0 Docker Desktop no longer logs system environment variables as part of diagnostics log collection.",
