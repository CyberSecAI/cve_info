    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CCX could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.&nbsp This vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of Java objects by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Java object to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of an affected device as a low-privilege user. A successful exploit could also allow the attacker to undertake further actions to elevate their privileges to root.",
