This vulnerability is due to insufficient integrity checks within device backup files. An attacker with valid administrative credentials could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious backup file and restoring it to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain shell access on the underlying operating system with the privileges of root.",
