    "description": "Zulip is an open-source team chat application. From versions 2.0.0-rc1 to before 10.4 in Zulip Server, the /digest/ URL of a server shows a preview of what the email weekly digest would contain. This URL, though not the digest itself, contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in both topic names and channel names. This issue has been fixed in Zulip Server 10.4. A workaround for this issue involves denying access to /digest/.",
