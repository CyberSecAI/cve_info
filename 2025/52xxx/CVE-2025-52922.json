    "description": "Innoshop through 0.4.1 allows directory traversal via FileManager API endpoints. An authenticated attacker with access to the admin panel could abuse this to (1) fully map the filesystem structure via the /api/file_manager/files?base_folder= endpoint, (2) create arbitrary directories on the server via the /api/file_manager/directories endpoint, (3) read arbitrary files from the server by copying the file to a readable location within the application via the /api/file_manager/copy_files endpoint, {4) delete arbitrary files from the server via a DELETE request to /api/file_manager/files, or (5) create arbitrary files on the server by uploading them and then leveraging the /api/file_manager/move_files endpoint to move them anywhere in the filesystem.",
