    "description": "Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The ckpt_a and cpkt_b variables take user input (e.g. a path to a model) and pass it to the merge function in process_ckpt.py, which uses them to load the models on those paths with torch.load, which can lead to unsafe deserialization and remote code execution. As of time of publication, no known patches exist.",
