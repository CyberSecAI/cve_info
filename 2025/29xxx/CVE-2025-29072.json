    "description": "An integer overflow in Nethermind Juno before v.12.05 within the Sierra bytecode decompression logic within the cairo-lang-starknet-classes library could allow remote attackers to trigger an infinite loop (and high CPU usage) by submitting a malicious Declare v2/v3 transaction. This results in a denial-of-service condition for affected Starknet full-node implementations.",
