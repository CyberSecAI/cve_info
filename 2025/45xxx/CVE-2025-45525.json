    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability has been identified in the JavaScript library microlight version 0.0.7, a lightweight syntax highlighting library. When processing elements with non-standard CSS color values, the library fails to validate the result of a regular expression match before accessing its properties, leading to an uncaught TypeError and potential application crash. NOTE this is disputed by multiple parties because there is no common scenario in which an adversary can insert those non-standard values.",
