  "description": "The Live Auction Cockpit in SAP Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) uses a deprecated java applet component within the affected SRM stack to accept binary Java objects in specific encoding format. On successful exploitation, an authenticated attacker with high privileges could send malicious payload request and receive an outbound DNS request, resulting in deserialization of data in the application. This vulnerability has low impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability of the application.",
