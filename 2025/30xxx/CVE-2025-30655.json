  "timestamp": "2025-07-04T16:12:41.853043+00:00",
  "description": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low-privileged attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS). When a specific show bgp neighbor CLI command is run, the rpd cpu utilization rises and eventually causes a crash and restart. Repeated use of this command will cause a sustained DoS condition. The device is only affected if BGP RIB sharding and update-threading is enabled. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 21.2R3-S9, * from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S8, * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2. and Junos OS Evolved * All versions before 21.2R3-S9-EVO, * from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S8-EVO, * from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S6-EVO, * from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S2-EVO, * from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO, * from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO.",
