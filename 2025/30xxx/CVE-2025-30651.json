    "description": "A Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When an attacker sends a specific ICMPv6 packet to an interface with protocols router-advertisement configured, rpd crashes and restarts. Continued receipt of this packet will cause a sustained DoS condition. This issue only affects systems configured with IPv6. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 21.2R3-S9, * from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10, * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S4, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S2, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2 and Junos OS Evolved * All versions before 21.2R3-S9-EVO, * from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S10-EVO, * from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S6-EVO, * from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S4-EVO, * from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S2-EVO, * from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO.",
