    "description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 10.10.0 and prior to version 11.5.0, a suspended user can use the token generated in session auth mode to access the API despite their status. This happens because there is a check missing in `verifySessionJWT` to verify that a user is actually still active and allowed to access the API. One can extract the session token obtained by, e.g. login in to the app while still active and then, after the user has been suspended continue to use that token until it expires. Version 11.5.0 patches the issue.",
