    "description": "In Apache CloudStack, a flaw in access control affects the listTemplates and listIsos APIs. A malicious Domain Admin or Resource Admin can exploit this issue by intentionally specifying the domainid parameter along with the filter=self or filter=selfexecutable values. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized visibility into templates and ISOs under the ROOT domain. A malicious admin can enumerate and extract metadata of templates and ISOs that belong to unrelated domains, violating isolation boundaries and potentially exposing sensitive or internal configuration details. This vulnerability has been fixed by ensuring the domain resolution strictly adheres to the callers scope rather than defaulting to the ROOT domain. Affected users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.19.3.0 or 4.20.1.0.",
