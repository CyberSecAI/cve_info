    "description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the packet forwarding engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS). In a subscriber management scenario, login/logout activity triggers a memory leak, and the leaked memory gradually increments and eventually results in a crash. user@host> show chassis fpc Temp CPU Utilization (%) CPU Utilization (%) Memory Utilization (%) Slot State (C) Total Interrupt 1min 5min 15min DRAM (MB) Heap Buffer 2 Online 36 10 0 9 8 9 32768 26 0 This issue affects Junos OS on MX Series * All versions before 21.2R3-S9 * from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10 * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6 * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5 * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3 * from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3 * from 24.2 before 24.2R2.",
