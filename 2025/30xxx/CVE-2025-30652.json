    "description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low-privileged attacker executing a CLI command to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When asregex-optimized is configured and a specific show route as-path CLI command is executed, the rpd crashes and restarts. Repeated execution of this command will cause a sustained DoS condition. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 21.2R3-S9, * from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10, * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4, * from 24.2 before 24.2R2. and Junos OS Evolved * All versions before 21.2R3-S9-EVO, * from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S10-EVO, * from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S6-EVO, * from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S6-EVO, * from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO, * from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-S4-EVO, * from 24.2-EVO before 24.2R2-EVO.",
