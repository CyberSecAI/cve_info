  "description": "An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the syslog stream TCP transport of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480 and MX960 devices with MX-SPC3 Security Services Card allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker, to send specific spoofed packets to cause a CPU Denial of Service (DoS) to the MX-SPC3 SPUs. Continued receipt and processing of these specific packets will sustain the DoS condition. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 22.2R3-S6, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S4, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4, * from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2 An indicator of compromise will indicate the SPC3 SPUs utilization has spiked. For example user@device> show services service-sets summary Service sets CPU Interface configured Bytes used Session bytes used Policy bytes used utilization interface 1 bytes (percent%) sessions (percent%) bytes (percent%) 99.97 % OVLD <<<<<< look for high CPU usage",
