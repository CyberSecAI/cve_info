  "description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Anti-Virus processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS). On all SRX platforms with Anti-Virus enabled, if a server sends specific content in the HTTP body of a response to a client request, these packets are queued by Anti-Virus processing in Juniper Buffers (jbufs) which are never released. When these jbufs are exhausted, the device stops forwarding all transit traffic. A jbuf memory leak can be noticed from the following logs (.) Warning jbuf pool id utilization level (%) is above %! To recover from this issue, the affected device needs to be manually rebooted to free the leaked jbufs. This issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series * all versions before 21.2R3-S9, * 21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10, * 22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6, * 22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S6, * 23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S3, * 23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S3, * 24.2 versions before 24.2R2.",
