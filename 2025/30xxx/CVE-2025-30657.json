    "description": "An Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output vulnerability in the Sampling Route Record Daemon (SRRD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS). When a device configured for flow-monitoring receives a specific BGP update message, it is correctly processed internally by the routing protocol daemon (rpd), but when its sent to SRRD its encoded incorrectly which leads to a crash and momentary interruption of jflow processing until it automatically restarts. This issue does not affect traffic forwarding itself. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 21.2R3-S9, * 21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10, * 22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6, * 22.4 versions before 22.4R3, * 23.2 versions before 23.2R1-S2, 23.2R2. This issue does not affected Junos OS Evolved.",
