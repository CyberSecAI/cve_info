    "description": "Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in Apache ORC. A vulnerability has been identified in the ORC C++ LZO decompression logic, where specially crafted malformed ORC files can cause the decompressor to allocate a 250-byte buffer but then attempts to copy 295 bytes into it. It causes memory corruption. This issue affects Apache ORC C++ library through 1.8.8, from 1.9.0 through 1.9.5, from 2.0.0 through 2.0.4, from 2.1.0 through 2.1.1. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.9, 1.9.6, 2.0.5, and 2.1.2, which fix the issue.",
