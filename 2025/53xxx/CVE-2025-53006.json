    "description": "DataEase is an open source business intelligence and data visualization tool. Prior to version 2.10.11, in both PostgreSQL and Redshift, apart from parameters like socketfactory and socketfactoryarg, there are also sslfactory and sslfactoryarg with similar functionality. The difference lies in that sslfactory and related parameters need to be triggered after establishing the connection. Other similar parameters include sslhostnameverifier, sslpasswordcallback, and authenticationPluginClassName. This issue has been patched in 2.10.11.",
