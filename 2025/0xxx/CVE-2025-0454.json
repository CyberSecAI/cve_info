The vulnerability arises due to a hostname confusion between the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` library and the `requests` library. A malicious user can exploit this by submitting a specially crafted URL, such as `http//localhost\\\\@google.com/../`, to bypass the SSRF check and perform an SSRF attack.",
