  "description": "Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in a Render function of Formulatrix Rock Maker Web (RMW) allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive data via arbitrary code execution. A malicious actor could execute malicious scripts to automatically download configuration files in known locations to exfiltrate data including credentials, and with no rate limiting a malicious actor could enumerate the filesystem of the host machine and potentially lead to full host compromise. This issue affects Rock Maker Web from 3.2.1.1 and later",
