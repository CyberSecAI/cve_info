    "description": "A vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows allows a remote attacker to run ActiveX controls within the context of an authenticated Windows user. This enables the attacker to run commands as if they are a legitimate authenticated user. However, to exploit this vulnerability, the authenticated user must navigate to a malicious page during the GlobalProtect SAML login process on a Windows device. This issue does not apply to the GlobalProtect app on other (non-Windows) platforms.",
