    "description": "Sending a crafted SOAP provision operation message archive field within the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) internal Radio Access Network (RAN) management network can cause path traversal issue in Nokia Single RAN baseband software with versions earlier than release 24R1-SR 1.0 MP. This issue has been corrected to release 24R1-SR 1.0 MP and later. Beginning with release 24R1-SR 1.0 MP, the OAM service software utilizes libarchive APIs with security options enabled, effectively mitigating the reported path traversal issue.",
