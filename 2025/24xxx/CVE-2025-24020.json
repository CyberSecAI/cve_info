    "description": "WeGIA is a Web manager for charitable institutions. An Open Redirect vulnerability was identified in the `control.php` endpoint of versions up to and including 3.2.10 of the WeGIA application. The vulnerability allows the `nextPage` parameter to be manipulated, redirecting authenticated users to arbitrary external URLs without validation. The issue stems from the lack of validation for the `nextPage` parameter, which accepts external URLs as redirection destinations. This vulnerability can be exploited to perform phishing attacks or redirect users to malicious websites. Version 3.2.11 contains a fix for the issue.",
