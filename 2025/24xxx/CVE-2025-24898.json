    "description": "rust-openssl is a set of OpenSSL bindings for the Rust programming language. In affected versions `sslselect_next_proto` can return a slice pointing into the `server` arguments buffer but with a lifetime bound to the `client` argument. In situations where the `sever` buffers lifetime is shorter than the `client` buffers, this can cause a use after free. This could cause the server to crash or to return arbitrary memory contents to the client. The crate`openssl` version 0.10.70 fixes the signature of `sslselect_next_proto` to properly constrain the output buffers lifetime to that of both input buffers. Users are advised to upgrade. In standard usage of `sslselect_next_proto` in the callback passed to `SslContextBuilderset_alpn_select_callback`, code is only affected if the `server` buffer is constructed *within* the callback.",
