    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved objtool, spi amd Fix out-of-bounds stack access in amd_set_spi_freq() If speed_hz < AMD_SPI_MIN_HZ, amd_set_spi_freq() iterates over the entire amd_spi_freq array without breaking out early, causing i to go beyond the array bounds. Fix that by stopping the loop when it gets to the last entry, so the low speed_hz value gets clamped up to AMD_SPI_MIN_HZ. Fixes the following warning with an UBSAN kernel drivers/spi/spi-amd.o error objtool amd_set_spi_freq() falls through to next function amd_spi_set_opcode()",
