    "description": "PNETLab 4.2.10 does not properly sanitize user inputs in its file access mechanisms. This allows attackers to perform directory traversal by manipulating file paths in HTTP requests. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to requests that access sensitive files outside the intended directory.",
