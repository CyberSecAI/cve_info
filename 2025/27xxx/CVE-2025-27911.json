    "description": "An issue was discovered in Datalust Seq before 2024.3.13545. Expansion of identifiers in message templates can be used to bypass the system Event body limit bytes setting, leading to increased resource consumption. With sufficiently large events, there can be disk space exhaustion (if saved to disk) or a termination of the server process with an out-of-memory error.",
