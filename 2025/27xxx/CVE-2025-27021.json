    "description": "The misconfiguration in the sudoers configuration of the operating system in Infinera G42 version R6.1.3 allows low privileged OS users to read/write physical memory via devmem command line tool. This could allow sensitive information disclosure, denial of service, and privilege escalation by tampering with kernel memory. Details The output of sudo -l reports the presence of devmem command executable as super user without using a password. This command allows to read and write an arbitrary memory area of the target device, specifying an absolute address.",
