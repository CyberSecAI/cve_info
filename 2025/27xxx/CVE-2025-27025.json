  "description": "The target device exposes a service on a specific TCP port with a configured endpoint. The access to that endpoint is granted using a Basic Authentication method. The endpoint accepts also the PUT method and it is possible to write files on the target device file system. Files are written as root. Using Postman it is possible to perform a Directory Traversal attack and write files into any location of the device file system. Similarly to the PUT method, it is possible to leverage the same mechanism to read any file from the file system by using the GET method.",
