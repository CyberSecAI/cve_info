    "description": "Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS before 2.10.0. The FileObject API in Commons VFS has a resolveFile method that takes a scope parameter. Specifying NameScope.DESCENDENT promises that an exception is thrown if the resolved file is not a descendent of the base file. However, when the path contains encoded .. characters (for example, %2E%2E/bar.txt), it might return file objects that are not a descendent of the base file, without throwing an exception. This issue affects Apache Commons VFS before 2.10.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue.",
