    "description": "Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In versions starting from 7.0.0 to before 8.0.2, a stack-based buffer overflow exists in redis-check-aof due to the use of memcpy with strlen(filepath) when copying a user-supplied file path into a fixed-size stack buffer. This allows an attacker to overflow the stack and potentially achieve code execution. This issue has been patched in version 8.0.2.",
