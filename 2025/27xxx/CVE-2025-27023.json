    "description": "Lack or insufficent input validation in WebGUI CLI web in Infinera G42 version R6.1.3 allows remote authenticated users to read all OS files via crafted CLI commands. Details The web interface based management of the Infinera G42 appliance enables the feature of executing a restricted set of commands. This feature also offers the option to execute a script-file already present on the target device. When a non-script or incorrect file is specified, the content of the file is shown along with an error message. Due to an execution of the http service with a privileged user all files on the file system can be viewed this way.",
