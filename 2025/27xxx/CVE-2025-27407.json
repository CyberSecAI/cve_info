    "description": "graphql-ruby is a Ruby implementation of GraphQL. Starting in version 1.11.5 and prior to versions 1.11.8, 1.12.25, 1.13.24, 2.0.32, 2.1.14, 2.2.17, and 2.3.21, loading a malicious schema definition in `GraphQLSchema.from_introspection` (or `GraphQLSchemaLoader.load`) can result in remote code execution. Any system which loads a schema by JSON from an untrusted source is vulnerable, including those that use GraphQLClient to load external schemas via GraphQL introspection. Versions 1.11.8, 1.12.25, 1.13.24, 2.0.32, 2.1.14, 2.2.17, and 2.3.21 contain a patch for the issue.",
