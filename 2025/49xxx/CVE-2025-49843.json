    "description": "conda-smithy is a tool for combining a conda recipe with configurations to build using freely hosted CI services into a single repository. Prior to version 3.47.1, the travis_headers function in the conda-smithy repository creates files with permissions exceeding 0o600, allowing read and write access beyond the intended user/owner. This violates the principle of least privilege, which mandates restricting file permissions to the minimum necessary. An attacker could exploit this to access configuration files in shared hosting environments. This issue has been patched in version 3.47.1.",
