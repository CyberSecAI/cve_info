    "description": "conda-forge-webservices is the web app deployed to run conda-forge admin commands and linting. Prior to version 2025.3.24, the conda_forge_webservice Docker container executes commands without specifying a user. By default, Docker containers run as the root user, which increases the risk of privilege escalation and host compromise if a vulnerability is exploited.
