    "description": "The backup ZIPs are not signed by the application, leading to the possibility that an attacker can download a backup ZIP, modify and re-upload it. This allows the attacker to disrupt the application by configuring the services in a way that they are unable to run, making the application unusable. They can redirect traffic that is meant to be internal to their own hosted services and gathering information.",
