    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/mlx5e Disable MACsec offload for uplink representor profile MACsec offload is not supported in switchdev mode for uplink representors. When switching to the uplink representor profile, the MACsec offload feature must be cleared from the netdevices features. If left enabled, attempts to add offloads result in a null pointer dereference, as the uplink representor does not support MACsec offload even though the feature bit remains set. Clear NETIF_F_HW_MACSEC in mlx5e_fix_uplink_rep_features(). Kernel log Oops general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc000000000f 0000",
