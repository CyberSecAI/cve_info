    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net_sched ets fix a race in ets_qdisc_change() Gerrard Tai reported a race condition in ETS, whenever SFQ perturb timer fires at the wrong time. The race is as follows CPU 0 CPU 1 [1] lock root [2] qdisc_tree_flush_backlog() [3] unlock root | | [5] lock root | [6] rehash | [7] qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() | [4] qdisc_put() This can be abused to underflow a parents qlen. Calling qdisc_purge_queue() instead of qdisc_tree_flush_backlog() should fix the race, because all packets will be purged from the qdisc before releasing the lock.",
