    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nvmet-tcp dont restore null sk_state_change queue->state_change is set as part of nvmet_tcp_set_queue_sock(), but if the TCP connection isnt established when nvmet_tcp_set_queue_sock() is called then queue->state_change isnt set and sock->sk->sk_state_change isnt replaced. As such we dont need to restore sock->sk->sk_state_change if queue->state_change is NULL. This avoids NULL pointer dereferences such as this [ 286.462026][ C0]",
