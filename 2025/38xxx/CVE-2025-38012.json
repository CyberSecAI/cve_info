    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sched_ext bpf_iter_scx_dsq_new() should always initialize iterator BPF programs may call next() and destroy() on BPF iterators even after new() returns an error value (e.g. bpf_for_each() macro ignores error returns from new()). bpf_iter_scx_dsq_new() could leave the iterator in an uninitialized state after an error return causing bpf_iter_scx_dsq_next() to dereference garbage data. Make bpf_iter_scx_dsq_new() always clear $kit->dsq so that next() and destroy() become noops.",
