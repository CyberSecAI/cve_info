    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved io_uring/fdinfo grab ctx->uring_lock around io_uring_show_fdinfo() Not everything requires locking in there, which is why the has_lock variable exists. But enough does that its a bit unwieldy to manage. Wrap the whole thing in a ->uring_lock trylock, and just return with no output if we fail to grab it. The existing trylock() will already have greatly diminished utility/output for the failure case. This fixes an issue with reading the SQE fields, if the ring is being actively resized at the same time.",
