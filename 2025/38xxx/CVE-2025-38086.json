    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net ch9200 fix uninitialised access during mii_nway_restart In mii_nway_restart() the code attempts to call mii->mdio_read which is ch9200_mdio_read(). ch9200_mdio_read() utilises a local buffer called buff, which is initialised with control_read(). However buff is conditionally initialised inside control_read() if (err == size) { memcpy(data, buf, size) } If the condition of err == size is not met, then buff remains uninitialised. Once this happens the uninitialised buff is accessed and returned during ch9200_mdio_read() return (buff[0] | buff[1] << 8) The problem stems from the fact that ch9200_mdio_read() ignores the return value of control_read(), leading to uinit-access of buff. To fix this we should check the return value of control_read() and return early on error.",
