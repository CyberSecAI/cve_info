    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs correct the order of prelim_ref arguments in btrfs__prelim_ref btrfs_prelim_ref() calls the old and new reference variables in the incorrect order. This causes a NULL pointer dereference because oldref is passed as NULL to trace_btrfs_prelim_ref_insert(). Note, trace_btrfs_prelim_ref_insert() is being called with newref as oldref (and oldref as NULL) on purpose in order to print out the values of newref. To reproduce echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/btrfs/btrfs_prelim_ref_insert/enable Perform some writeback operations. Backtrace",
