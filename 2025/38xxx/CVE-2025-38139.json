  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfs Fix oops in write-retry from mis-resetting the subreq iterator Fix the resetting of the subrequest iterator in netfs_retry_write_stream() to use the iterator-reset function as the iterator may have been shortened by a previous retry. In such a case, the amount of data to be written by the subrequest is not subreq->len but subreq->len - subreq->transferred.
