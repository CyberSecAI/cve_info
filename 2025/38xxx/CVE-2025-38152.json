    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved remoteproc core Clear table_sz when rproc_shutdown There is case as below could trigger kernel dump Use U-Boot to start remote processor(rproc) with resource table published to a fixed address by rproc. After Kernel boots up, stop the rproc, load a new firmware which doesnt have resource table ,and start rproc. When starting rproc with a firmware not have resource table, `memcpy(loaded_table, rproc->cached_table, rproc->table_sz)` will trigger dump, because rproc->cache_table is set to NULL during the last stop operation, but rproc->table_sz is still valid. This issue is found on i.MX8MP and i.MX9. Dump as below Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000 Mem abort info ESR = 0x0000000096000004 EC = 0x25 DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits SET = 0, FnV = 0 EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 FSC = 0x04 level 0 translation fault Data abort info ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000004, ISS2 = 0x00000000 CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0 GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0 user pgtable 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=000000010af63000 [0000000000000000] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000 Internal error Oops 0000000096000004",
