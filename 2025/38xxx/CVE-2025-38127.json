    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ice fix Tx scheduler error handling in XDP callback When the XDP program is loaded, the XDP callback adds new Tx queues. This means that the callback must update the Tx scheduler with the new queue number. In the event of a Tx scheduler failure, the XDP callback should also fail and roll back any changes previously made for XDP preparation. The previous implementation had a bug that not all changes made by the XDP callback were rolled back. This caused the crash with the following call trace [ +9.549584] ice 0000ca00.0 Failed VSI LAN queue config for XDP, error -5 [ +0.382335] Oops general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0x50a2250a90495525 0000",
