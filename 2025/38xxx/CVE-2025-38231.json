    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nfsd Initialize ssc before laundromat_work to prevent NULL dereference In nfs4_state_start_net(), laundromat_work may access nfsd_ssc through nfs4_laundromat -> nfsd4_ssc_expire_umount. If nfsd_ssc isnt initialized, this can cause NULL pointer dereference. Normally the delayed start of laundromat_work allows sufficient time for nfsd_ssc initialization to complete. However, when the kernel waits too long for userspace responses (e.g. in nfs4_state_start_net -> nfsd4_end_grace -> nfsd4_record_grace_done -> nfsd4_cld_grace_done -> cld_pipe_upcall -> __cld_pipe_upcall -> wait_for_completion path), the delayed work may start before nfsd_ssc initialization finishes. Fix this by moving nfsd_ssc initialization before starting laundromat_work.",
