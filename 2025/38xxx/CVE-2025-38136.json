    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb renesas_usbhs Reorder clock handling and power management in probe Reorder the initialization sequence in `usbhs_probe()` to enable runtime PM before accessing registers, preventing potential crashes due to uninitialized clocks. Currently, in the probe path, registers are accessed before enabling the clocks, leading to a synchronous external abort on the RZ/V2H SoC. The problematic call flow is as follows usbhs_probe() usbhs_sys_clock_ctrl() usbhs_bset() usbhs_write() iowrite16() <-- Register access before enabling clocks Since `iowrite16()` is performed without ensuring the required clocks are enabled, this can lead to access errors. To fix this, enable PM runtime early in the probe function and ensure clocks are acquired before register access, preventing crashes like the following on RZ/V2H",
