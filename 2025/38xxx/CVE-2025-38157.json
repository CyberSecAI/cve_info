    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi ath9k_htc Abort software beacon handling if disabled A malicious USB device can send a WMI_SWBA_EVENTID event from an ath9k_htc-managed device before beaconing has been enabled. This causes a device-by-zero error in the driver, leading to either a crash or an out of bounds read. Prevent this by aborting the handling in ath9k_htc_swba() if beacons are not enabled.",
