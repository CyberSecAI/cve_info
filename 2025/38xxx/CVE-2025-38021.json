    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Fix null check of pipe_ctx->plane_state for update_dchubp_dpp Similar to commit 6a057072ddd1 (drm/amd/display Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe) that addresses a null pointer dereference on dcn20_update_dchubp_dpp. This is the same function hooked for update_dchubp_dpp in dcn401, with the same issue. Fix possible null pointer deference on dcn401_program_pipe too. (cherry picked from commit d8d47f739752227957d8efc0cb894761bfe1d879)",
