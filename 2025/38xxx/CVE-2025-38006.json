    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net mctp Dont access ifa_index when missing In mctp_dump_addrinfo, ifa_index can be used to filter interfaces, but only when the struct ifaddrmsg is provided. Otherwise it will be comparing to uninitialised memory - reproducible in the syzkaller case from dhcpd, or busybox ip addr show. The kernel MCTP implementation has always filtered by ifa_index, so existing userspace programs expecting to dump MCTP addresses must already be passing a valid ifa_index value (either 0 or a real index).
