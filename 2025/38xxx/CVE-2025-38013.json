    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi mac80211 Set n_channels after allocating struct cfg80211_scan_request Make sure that n_channels is set after allocating the struct cfg80211_registered_deviceint_scan_req member. Seen with syzkaller UBSAN array-index-out-of-bounds in net/mac80211/scan.c12085 index 0 is out of range for type struct ieee80211_channel *[] __counted_by(n_channels) (aka struct ieee80211_channel *[]) This was missed in the initial conversions because I failed to locate the allocation likely due to the sizeof(void *) not matching the channels array type.",
