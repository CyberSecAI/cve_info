    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/mediatek dp drm_err => dev_err in HPD path to avoid NULL ptr The function mtk_dp_wait_hpd_asserted() may be called before the `mtk_dp->drm_dev` pointer is assigned in mtk_dp_bridge_attach(). Specifically it can be called via this callpath - mtk_edp_wait_hpd_asserted - [panel probe] - dp_aux_ep_probe Using drm level prints anywhere in this callpath causes a NULL pointer dereference. Change the error message directly in mtk_dp_wait_hpd_asserted() to dev_err() to avoid this. Also change the error messages in mtk_dp_parse_capabilities(), which is called by mtk_dp_wait_hpd_asserted(). While touching these prints, also add the error code to them to make future debugging easier.",
