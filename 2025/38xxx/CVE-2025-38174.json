    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved thunderbolt Do not double dequeue a configuration request Some of our devices crash in tb_cfg_request_dequeue() general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000122 CPU 6 PID 91007 Comm kworker/62 Tainted G U W 6.6.65 RIP 0010tb_cfg_request_dequeue+0x2d/0xa0 Call Trace ? tb_cfg_request_dequeue+0x2d/0xa0 tb_cfg_request_work+0x33/0x80 worker_thread+0x386/0x8f0 kthread+0xed/0x110 ret_from_fork+0x38/0x50 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30 The circumstances are unclear, however, the theory is that tb_cfg_request_work() can be scheduled twice for a request first time via frame.callback from ring_work() and second time from tb_cfg_request(). Both times kworkers will execute tb_cfg_request_dequeue(), which results in double list_del() from the ctl->request_queue (the list poison deference hints at it 0xdead000000000122). Do not dequeue requests that dont have TB_CFG_REQUEST_ACTIVE bit set.",
