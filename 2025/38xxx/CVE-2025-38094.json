    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net cadence macb Fix a possible deadlock in macb_halt_tx. There is a situation where after THALT is set high, TGO stays high as well. Because jiffies are never updated, as we are in a context with interrupts disabled, we never exit that loop and have a deadlock. That deadlock was noticed on a sama5d4 device that stayed locked for days. Use retries instead of jiffies so that the timeout really works and we do not have a deadlock anymore.",
