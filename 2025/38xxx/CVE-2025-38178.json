  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved EDAC/igen6 Fix NULL pointer dereference A kernel panic was reported with the following kernel log EDAC igen6 Expected 2 mcs, but only 1 detected. BUG unable to handle page fault for address 000000000000d570 ... Hardware name Notebook V54x_6x_TU/V54x_6x_TU, BIOS Dasharo (coreboot+UEFI) v0.9.0 07/17/2024 RIP e030ecclog_handler+0x7e/0xf0 [igen6_edac] ... igen6_probe+0x2a0/0x343 [igen6_edac] ... igen6_init+0xc5/0xff0 [igen6_edac] ... This issue occurred because one memory controller was disabled by the BIOS but the igen6_edac driver still checked all the memory controllers, including this absent one, to identify the source of the error. Accessing the null MMIO for the absent memory controller resulted in the oops above. Fix this issue by reverting the configuration structure to non-const and updating the field res_cfg->num_imc to reflect the number of detected memory controllers.",
