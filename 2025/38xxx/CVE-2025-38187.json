    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/nouveau fix a use-after-free in r535_gsp_rpc_push() The RPC container is released after being passed to r535_gsp_rpc_send(). When sending the initial fragment of a large RPC and passing the callers RPC container, the container will be freed prematurely. Subsequent attempts to send remaining fragments will therefore result in a use-after-free. Allocate a temporary RPC container for holding the initial fragment of a large RPC when sending. Free the callers container when all fragments are successfully sent. [ Rebase onto Blackwell changes. - Danilo ]",
