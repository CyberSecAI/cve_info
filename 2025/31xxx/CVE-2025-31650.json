  "description": "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. Incorrect error handling for some invalid HTTP priority headers resulted in incomplete clean-up of the failed request which created a memory leak. A large number of such requests could trigger an OutOfMemoryException resulting in a denial of service. This issue affects Apache Tomcat from 9.0.76 through 9.0.102, from 10.1.10 through 10.1.39, from 11.0.0-M2 through 11.0.5. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.104, 10.1.40 or 11.0.6 which fix the issue.",
