    "description": "Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. ZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called Ignoring unknown usernames which helps mitigate attacks that try to guess/enumerate usernames. If enabled, ZITADEL will show the password prompt even if the user doesnt exist and report Username or Password invalid. While the setting was correctly respected during the login flow, the users username was normalized leading to a disclosure of the users existence. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.71.6, 2.70.8, 2.69.9, 2.68.9, 2.67.13, 2.66.16, 2.65.7, 2.64.6, and 2.63.9.",
