    "description": "API Platform Core is a system to create hypermedia-driven REST and GraphQL APIs. Prior to 4.0.22 and 3.4.17, a GraphQL grant on a property might be cached with different objects. The ApiPlatform\\\\GraphQl\\\\Serializer\\\\ItemNormalizerisCacheKeySafe() method is meant to prevent the caching but the parentnormalize method that is called afterwards still creates the cache key and causes the issue. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.0.22 and 3.4.17.",
