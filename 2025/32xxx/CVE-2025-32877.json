    "description": "An issue was discovered on COROS PACE 3 devices through 3.0808.0. It identifies itself as a device without input or output capabilities, which results in the use of the Just Works pairing method. This method does not implement any authentication, which therefore allows machine-in-the-middle attacks. Furthermore, this lack of authentication allows attackers to interact with the device via BLE without requiring prior authorization.",
