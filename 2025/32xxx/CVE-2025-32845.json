    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in TeleControl Server Basic (All versions < V3.1.2.2). The affected application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the internally used UpdateGeneralSettings method. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to bypass authorization controls, to read from and write to the applications database and execute code with NT AUTHORITY\\\\NetworkService permissions. A successful attack requires the attacker to be able to access port 8000 on a system where a vulnerable version of the affected application is executed on.",
