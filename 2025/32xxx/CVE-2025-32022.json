    "description": "Finit provides fast init for Linux systems. Finits urandom plugin has a heap buffer overwrite vulnerability at boot which leads to it overwriting other parts of the heap, possibly causing random instabilities and undefined behavior. The urandom plugin is enabled by default, so this bug affects everyone using Finit 4.2 or later that do not explicitly disable the plugin at build time. This bug is fixed in Finit 4.12. Those who cannot upgrade or backport the fix to urandom.c are strongly recommended to disable the plugin in the call to the `configure` script.",
