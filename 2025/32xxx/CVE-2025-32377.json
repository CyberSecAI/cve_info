    "description": "Rasa Pro is a framework for building scalable, dynamic conversational AI assistants that integrate large language models (LLMs). A vulnerability has been identified in Rasa Pro where voice connectors in Rasa Pro do not properly implement authentication even when a token is configured in the credentials.yml file. This could allow an attacker to submit voice data to the Rasa Pro assistant from an unauthenticated source. This issue has been patched for audiocodes, audiocodes_stream, and genesys connectors in versions 3.9.20, 3.10.19, 3.11.7 and 3.12.6.",
