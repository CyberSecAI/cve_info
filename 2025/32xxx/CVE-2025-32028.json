    "description": "HAX CMS PHP allows you to manage your microsite universe with PHP backend. Multiple file upload functions within the HAX CMS PHP application call a save function in HAXCMSFile.php. This save function uses a denylist to block specific file types from being uploaded to the server. This list is non-exhaustive and only blocks .php, .sh, .js, and .css files. The existing logic causes the system to fail open rather than fail closed. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.0.3.",
