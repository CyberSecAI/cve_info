A bypass has been identified for the previously known vulnerability CVE-2017-0929, allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary GET requests against target systems, including internal or adjacent networks. This vulnerability facilitates a semi-blind SSRF attack, allowing attackers to make the target server send requests to internal or external URLs without viewing the full responses.
