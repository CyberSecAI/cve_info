  "description": "SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This enables an attacker, without requiring any privileges, to inject malicious JavaScript into a website. When a user visits the compromised page, the injected script gets executed, potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity within the scope of the victims browser. Availability is not impacted.",
