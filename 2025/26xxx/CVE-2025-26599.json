    "description": "An access to an uninitialized pointer flaw was found in X.Org and Xwayland. The function compCheckRedirect() may fail if it cannot allocate the backing pixmap. In that case, compRedirectWindow() will return a BadAlloc error without validating the window tree marked just before, which leaves the validated data partly initialized and the use of an uninitialized pointer later.",
