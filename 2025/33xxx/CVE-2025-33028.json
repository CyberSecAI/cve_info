  "description": "In WinZip through 29.0, there is a Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-8811. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of WinZip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files. When extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, WinZip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
