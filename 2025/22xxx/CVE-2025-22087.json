    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Fix array bounds error with may_goto may_goto uses an additional 8 bytes on the stack, which causes the interpreters[] array to go out of bounds when calculating index by stack_size. 1. If a BPF program is rewritten, re-evaluate the stack size. For non-JIT cases, reject loading directly. 2. For non-JIT cases, calculating interpreters[idx] may still cause out-of-bounds array access, and just warn about it. 3. For jit_requested cases, the execution of bpf_func also needs to be warned. So move the definition of function __bpf_prog_ret0_warn out of the macro definition CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON.",
