    "description": "An attacker with access to the Administration panel, specifically the Role Management tab, can inject code by adding a new role in the name field. It should be noted, however, that the risk of exploiting vulnerability is reduced due to the required additional error that allows bypassing the Content-Security-Policy policy, which mitigates JS code execution while still allowing HTML injection. This issue affects CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager in SaaS version 24.7.1. The status of other versions is unknown. After multiple attempts to contact the vendor we did not receive any answer.",
