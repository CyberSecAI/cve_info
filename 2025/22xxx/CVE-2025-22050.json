    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usbnetfix NPE during rx_complete Missing usbnet_going_away Check in Critical Path. The usb_submit_urb function lacks a usbnet_going_away validation, whereas __usbnet_queue_skb includes this check. This inconsistency creates a race condition where A URB request may succeed, but the corresponding SKB data fails to be queued. Subsequent processes (e.g., rx_complete defer_bh __skb_unlink(skb, list)) attempt to access skb->next, triggering a NULL pointer dereference (Kernel Panic).",
