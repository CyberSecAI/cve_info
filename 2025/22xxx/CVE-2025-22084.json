    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved w1 fix NULL pointer dereference in probe The w1_uart_probe() function calls w1_uart_serdev_open() (which includes devm_serdev_device_open()) before setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This ordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controllers receive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev->ops is valid when SERPORT_ACTIVE is set. This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1 (platform/chrome cros_ec_uart properly fix race condition) where devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the device. Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via w1_uart_serdev_open().",
