    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved md/raid1,raid10 dont ignore IO flags If blk-wbt is enabled by default, its found that raid write performance is quite bad because all IO are throttled by wbt of underlying disks, due to flag REQ_IDLE is ignored. And turns out this behaviour exist since blk-wbt is introduced. Other than REQ_IDLE, other flags should not be ignored as well, for example REQ_META can be set for filesystems, clearing it can cause priority reverse problems And REQ_NOWAIT should not be cleared as well, because io will wait instead of failing directly in underlying disks. Fix those problems by keep IO flags from master bio. Fises f51d46d0e7cb (md add support for REQ_NOWAIT)",
