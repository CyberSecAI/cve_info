    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved PCI Fix NULL dereference in SR-IOV VF creation error path Clean up when virtfn setup fails to prevent NULL pointer dereference during device removal. The kernel oops below occurred due to incorrect error handling flow when pci_setup_device() fails. Add pci_iov_scan_device(), which handles virtfn allocation and setup and cleans up if pci_setup_device() fails, so pci_iov_add_virtfn() doesnt need to call pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device(). This prevents accessing partially initialized virtfn devices during removal.",
