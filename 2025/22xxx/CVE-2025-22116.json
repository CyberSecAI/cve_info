    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved idpf check error for register_netdev() on init Current init logic ignores the error code from register_netdev(), which will cause WARN_ON() on attempt to unregister it, if there was one, and there is no info for the user that the creation of the netdev failed.
