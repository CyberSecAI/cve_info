    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Bluetooth btnxpuart Fix kernel panic during FW release This fixes a kernel panic seen during release FW in a stress test scenario where WLAN and BT FW download occurs simultaneously, and due to a HW bug, chip sends out only 1 bootloader signatures. When driver receives the bootloader signature, it enters FW download mode, but since no consequtive bootloader signatures seen, FW file is not requested. After 60 seconds, when FW download times out, release_firmware causes a kernel panic.
