    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ksmbd fix r_count dec/increment mismatch r_count is only increased when there is an oplock break wait, so r_count inc/decrement are not paired. This can cause r_count to become negative, which can lead to a problem where the ksmbd thread does not terminate.",
