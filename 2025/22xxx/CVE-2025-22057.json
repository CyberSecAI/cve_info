    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net decrease cached dst counters in dst_release Upstream fix ac888d58869b (net do not delay dst_entries_add() in dst_release()) moved decrementing the dst count from dst_destroy to dst_release to avoid accessing already freed data in case of netns dismantle. However in case CONFIG_DST_CACHE is enabled and OvS+tunnels are used, this fix is incomplete as the same issue will be seen for cached dsts Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff5aabf6b5c000 Call trace percpu_counter_add_batch+0x3c/0x160 (P) dst_release+0xec/0x108 dst_cache_destroy+0x68/0xd8 dst_destroy+0x13c/0x168 dst_destroy_rcu+0x1c/0xb0 rcu_do_batch+0x18c/0x7d0 rcu_core+0x174/0x378 rcu_core_si+0x18/0x30 Fix this by invalidating the cache, and thus decrementing cached dst counters, in dst_release too.",
