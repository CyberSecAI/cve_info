    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved idpf fix adapter NULL pointer dereference on reboot With SRIOV enabled, idpf ends up calling into idpf_remove() twice. First via idpf_shutdown() and then again when idpf_remove() calls into sriov_disable(), because the VF devices use the idpf driver, hence the same remove routine. When that happens, it is possible for the adapter to be NULL from the first call to idpf_remove(), leading to a NULL pointer dereference. echo 1 > /sys/class/net//device/sriov_numvfs reboot",
