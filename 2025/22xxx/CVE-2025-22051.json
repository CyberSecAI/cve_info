    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved staging gpib Fix Oops after disconnect in agilent usb If the agilent usb dongle is disconnected subsequent calls to the driver cause a NULL dereference Oops as the bus_interface is set to NULL on disconnect. This problem was introduced by setting usb_dev from the bus_interface for dev_xxx messages. Previously bus_interface was checked for NULL only in the functions directly calling usb_fill_bulk_urb or usb_control_msg. Check for valid bus_interface on all interface entry points and return -ENODEV if it is NULL.",
