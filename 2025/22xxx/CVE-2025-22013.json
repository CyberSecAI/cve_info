    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM arm64 Unconditionally save+flush host FPSIMD/SVE/SME state There are several problems with the way hyp code lazily saves the hosts FPSIMD/SVE state, including * Host SVE being discarded unexpectedly due to inconsistent configuration of TIF_SVE and CPACR_ELx.ZEN. This has been seen to result in QEMU crashes where SVE is used by memmove(), as reported by Eric Auger https//issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-68997 * Host SVE state is discarded *after* modification by ptrace, which was an unintentional ptrace ABI change introduced with lazy discarding of SVE state. * The host FPMR value can be discarded when running a non-protected VM, where FPMR support is not exposed to a VM, and that VM uses FPSIMD/SVE. In these cases the hyp code does not save the hosts FPMR before unbinding the hosts FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, leaving a stale value in memory. Avoid these by eagerly saving and flushing the hosts FPSIMD/SVE/SME state when loading a vCPU such that KVM does not need to save any of the hosts FPSIMD/SVE/SME state. For clarity, fpsimd_kvm_prepare() is removed and the necessary call to fpsimd_save_and_flush_cpu_state() is placed in kvm_arch_vcpu_load_fp(). As fpsimd_state and fpmr_ptr should not be used, they are set to NULL all uses of these will be removed in subsequent patches. Historical problems go back at least as far as v5.17, e.g. erroneous assumptions about TIF_SVE being clear in commit 8383741ab2e773a9 (KVM arm64 Get rid of host SVE tracking/saving) ... and so this eager save+flush probably needs to be backported to ALL stable trees.",
