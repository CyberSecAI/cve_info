    "description": "A SQL injection vulnerability exists in Epicor HCM 2021 1.9, with patches available 5.16.0.1033/HCM2022, 5.17.0.1146/HCM2023, and 5.18.0.573/HCM2024. The injection is specifically in the filter parameter of the JsonFetcher.svc endpoint. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL payloads into the filter parameter, enabling the unauthorized execution of arbitrary SQL commands on the backend database. If certain features (like xp_cmdshell) are enabled, this may lead to remote code execution.",
