    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved clocksource Use migrate_disable() to avoid calling get_random_u32() in atomic context The following bug report happened with a PREEMPT_RT kernel BUG sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c48 in_atomic() 1, irqs_disabled() 0, non_block 0, pid 2012, name kwatchdog preempt_count 1, expected 0 RCU nest depth 0, expected 0 get_random_u32+0x4f/0x110 clocksource_verify_choose_cpus+0xab/0x1a0 clocksource_verify_percpu.part.0+0x6b/0x330 clocksource_watchdog_kthread+0x193/0x1a0 It is due to the fact that clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() is invoked with preemption disabled. This function invokes get_random_u32() to obtain random numbers for choosing CPUs. The batched_entropy_32 local lock and/or the base_crng.lock spinlock in driver/char/random.c will be acquired during the call. In PREEMPT_RT kernel, they are both sleeping locks and so cannot be acquired in atomic context. Fix this problem by using migrate_disable() to allow smp_processor_id() to be reliably used without introducing atomic context. preempt_disable() is then called after clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() but before the clocksource measurement is being run to avoid introducing unexpected latency.",
