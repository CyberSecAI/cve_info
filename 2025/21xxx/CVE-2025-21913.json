    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved x86/amd_nb Use rdmsr_safe() in amd_get_mmconfig_range() Xen doesnt offer MSR_FAM10H_MMIO_CONF_BASE to all guests.

Treating MMCFG as disabled is the right course of action, so no change is needed there. This was most likely exposed by fixing the Xen MSR accessors to not be silently-safe.",
