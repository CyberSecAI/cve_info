    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Fix out-of-bound accesses [WHAT & HOW] hpo_stream_to_link_encoder_mapping has size MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS(=4), but location can have size up to 6. As a result, it is necessary to check location against MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS. Similiarly, disp_cfg_stream_location can be used as an array index which should be 0..5, so the ASSERTs conditions should be less without equal.",
