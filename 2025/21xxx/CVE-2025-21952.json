    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved HID corsair-void Update power supply values with a unified work handler corsair_void_process_receiver can be called from an interrupt context, locking battery_mutex in it was causing a kernel panic. Fix it by moving the critical section into its own work, sharing this work with battery_add_work and battery_remove_work to remove the need for any locking",
