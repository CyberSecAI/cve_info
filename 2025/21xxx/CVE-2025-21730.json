    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi rtw89 avoid to init mgnt_entry list twice when WoWLAN failed If WoWLAN failed in resume flow, the rtw89_ops_add_interface() triggered without removing the interface first. Then the mgnt_entry list init again, causing the list_empty() check in rtw89_chanctx_ops_assign_vif() useless, and list_add_tail() again. Therefore, we have added a check to prevent double adding of the list. rtw89_8852ce 00000100.0 failed to check wow status disabled rtw89_8852ce 00000100.0 wow failed to check disable fw ready rtw89_8852ce 00000100.0 wow failed to swap to normal fw rtw89_8852ce 00000100.0 failed to disable wow rtw89_8852ce 00000100.0 failed to resume for wow -110 rtw89_8852ce 00000100.0 MAC has already powered on i2c_hid_acpi i2c-ILTK000100 PM acpi_subsys_resume+0x0/0x60 returned 0 after 284705 usecs list_add corruption. prev->next should be next (ffff9d9719d82228), but was ffff9d9719f96030.
