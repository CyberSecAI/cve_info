    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nvme-tcp fix potential memory corruption in nvme_tcp_recv_pdu() nvme_tcp_recv_pdu() doesnt check the validity of the header length. When header digests are enabled, a target might send a packet with an invalid header length (e.g. 255), causing nvme_tcp_verify_hdgst() to access memory outside the allocated area and cause memory corruptions by overwriting it with the calculated digest. Fix this by rejecting packets with an unexpected header length.",
