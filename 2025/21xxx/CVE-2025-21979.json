    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi cfg80211 cancel wiphy_work before freeing wiphy A wiphy_work can be queued from the moment the wiphy is allocated and initialized (i.e. wiphy_new_nm). When a wiphy_work is queued, the rdevwiphy_work is getting queued. If wiphy_free is called before the rdevwiphy_work had a chance to run, the wiphy memory will be freed, and then when it eventally gets to run itll use invalid memory. Fix this by canceling the work before freeing the wiphy.",
