    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved s390/ism add release function for struct device According to device_release() in /drivers/base/core.c, a device without a release function is a broken device and must be fixed. The current code directly frees the device after calling device_add() without waiting for other kernel parts to release their references. Thus, a reference could still be held to a struct device, e.g., by sysfs, leading to potential use-after-free issues if a proper release function is not set.",
