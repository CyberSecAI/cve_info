    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ipv6 mcast extend RCU protection in igmp6_send() igmp6_send() can be called without RTNL or RCU being held. Extend RCU protection so that we can safely fetch the net pointer and avoid a potential UAF. Note that we no longer can use sock_alloc_send_skb() because ipv6.igmp_sk uses GFP_KERNEL allocations which can sleep. Instead use alloc_skb() and charge the net->ipv6.igmp_sk socket under RCU protection.",
