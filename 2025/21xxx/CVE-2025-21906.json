    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi iwlwifi mvm clean up ROC on failure If the firmware fails to start the session protection, then we do call iwl_mvm_roc_finished() here, but that wont do anything at all because IWL_MVM_STATUS_ROC_P2P_RUNNING was never set. Set IWL_MVM_STATUS_ROC_P2P_RUNNING in the failure/stop path. If it started successfully before, its already set, so that doesnt matter, and if it didnt start it needs to be set to clean up. Not doing so will lead to a WARN_ON() later on a fresh remain- on-channel, since the link is already active when activated as it was never deactivated.",
