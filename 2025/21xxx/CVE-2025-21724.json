  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iommufd/iova_bitmap Fix shift-out-of-bounds in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index() Resolve a UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds issue in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index() where shifting the constant 1 (of type int) by bitmap->mapped.pgshift (an unsigned long value) could result in undefined behavior. The constant 1 defaults to a 32-bit int, and when pgshift exceeds 31 (e.g., pgshift = 63) the shift operation overflows, as the result cannot be represented in a 32-bit type. To resolve this, the constant is updated to 1UL, promoting it to an unsigned long type to match the operands type.",
