    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vsock prevent null-ptr-deref in vsock_*[has_data|has_space] Recent reports have shown how we sometimes call vsock_*_has_data() when a vsock socket has been de-assigned from a transport (see attached links), but we shouldnt. Previous commits should have solved the real problems, but we may have more in the future, so to avoid null-ptr-deref, we can return 0 (no space, no data available) but with a warning. This way the code should continue to run in a nearly consistent state and have a warning that allows us to debug future problems.",
