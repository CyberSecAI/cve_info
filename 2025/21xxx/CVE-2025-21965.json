    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sched_ext Validate prev_cpu in scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl() If a BPF scheduler provides an invalid CPU (outside the nr_cpu_ids range) as prev_cpu to scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl() it can cause a kernel crash. To prevent this, validate prev_cpu in scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl() and trigger an scx error if an invalid CPU is specified.",
