    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netmem prevent TX of unreadable skbs Currently on stable trees we have support for netmem/devmem RX but not TX. It is not safe to forward/redirect an RX unreadable netmem packet into the devices TX path, as the device may call dma-mapping APIs on dma addrs that should not be passed to it. Fix this by preventing the xmit of unreadable skbs. Tested by configuring tc redirect sudo tc qdisc add dev eth1 ingress sudo tc filter add dev eth1 ingress protocol ip prio 1 flower ip_proto \\\\ tcp src_ip 192.168.1.12 action mirred egress redirect dev eth1 Before, I see unreadable skbs in the drivers TX path passed to dma mapping APIs. After, I dont see unreadable skbs in the drivers TX path passed to dma mapping APIs.",
