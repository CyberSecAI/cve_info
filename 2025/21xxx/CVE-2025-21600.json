  "cveId": "CVE-2025-21600",

  "description": "An Out-of-Bounds Read vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, logically adjacent BGP peer sending a specifically malformed BGP packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue only affects systems configured in either of two ways * systems with BGP traceoptions enabled * systems with BGP family traffic-engineering (BGP-LS) configured and can be exploited from a directly connected and configured BGP peer. This issue affects iBGP and eBGP with any address family configured, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue affects Junos OS * from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S9, * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5, * from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3, * from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2 Junos OS Evolved * from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S9-EVO, * from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S5-EVO, * from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S4-EVO, * from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S5-EVO, * from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO, * from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-S2-EVO, * from 24.2-EVO before 24.2R1-S2-EVO, 24.2R2-EVO. This issue does not affect versions of Junos OS prior to 21.3R1. This issue does not affect versions of Junos OS Evolved prior to 21.3R1-EVO. This is a similar, but different vulnerability than the issue reported as CVE-2024-39516.",
