  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved llc do not use skb_get() before dev_queue_xmit() syzbot is able to crash hosts [1], using llc and devices not supporting IFF_TX_SKB_SHARING. In this case, e1000 driver calls eth_skb_pad(), while the skb is shared. Simply replace skb_get() by skb_clone() in net/llc/llc_s_ac.c Note that e1000 driver might have an issue with pktgen, because it does not clear IFF_TX_SKB_SHARING, this is an orthogonal change. We need to audit other skb_get() uses in net/llc. [1] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c2178 ! Oops invalid opcode 0000",
