    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ksmbd fix type confusion via race condition when using ipc_msg_send_request req->handle is allocated using ksmbd_acquire_id(&ipc_ida), based on ida_alloc. req->handle from ksmbd_ipc_login_request and FSCTL_PIPE_TRANSCEIVE ioctl can be same and it could lead to type confusion between messages, resulting in access to unexpected parts of memory after an incorrect delivery. ksmbd check type of ipc response but missing add continue to check next ipc reponse.",
