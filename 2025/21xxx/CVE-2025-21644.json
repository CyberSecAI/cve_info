This moves the xe_gt_tlb_invalidation_init() to be done earlier as its own doc says, its a software-only initialization and should had been named with the _early() suffix. Move it to be called by xe_gt_init_early(), so the locks and seqno are initialized, avoiding a NULL ptr deref when wedging xe 00000300.0 [drm] *ERROR* GT0 load failed status Reset = 0, BootROM = 0x50, UKernel = 0x00, MIA = 0x00, Auth = 0x01 xe 00000300.0 [drm] *ERROR* GT0 firmware signature verification failed xe 00000300.0 [drm] *ERROR* CRITICAL Xe has declared device 00000300.0 as wedged. ...",
