    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved USB serial quatech2 fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to an incorrect bounds check in the following if (newport > serial->num_ports) { dev_err(&port->dev, %s - port change to invalid port %i\\\\n, __func__, newport) break } The condition doesnt account for the valid range of the serial->port buffer, which is from 0 to serial->num_ports - 1. When newport is equal to serial->num_ports, the assignment of port in the following code is out-of-bounds and NULL serial_priv->current_port = newport port = serial->port[serial_priv->current_port] The fix checks if newport is greater than or equal to serial->num_ports indicating it is out-of-bounds.",
