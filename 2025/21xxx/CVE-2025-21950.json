    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drivers virt acrn hsm Use kzalloc to avoid info leak in pmcmd_ioctl In the pmcmd_ioctl function, three memory objects allocated by kmalloc are initialized by hcall_get_cpu_state, which are then copied to user space. The initializer is indeed implemented in acrn_hypercall2 (arch/x86/include/asm/acrn.h). There is a risk of information leakage due to uninitialized bytes.",
