    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved block mark GFP_NOIO around sysfs ->store() sysfs ->store is called with queue freezed, meantime we have several ->store() callbacks(update_nr_requests, wbt, scheduler) to allocate memory with GFP_KERNEL which may run into direct reclaim code path, then potential deadlock can be caused. Fix the issue by marking NOIO around sysfs ->store()",
