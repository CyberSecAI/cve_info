    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usbnet gl620a fix endpoint checking in genelink_bind() Syzbot reports [1] a warning in usb_submit_urb() triggered by inconsistencies between expected and actually present endpoints in gl620a driver. Since genelink_bind() does not properly verify whether specified eps are in fact provided by the device, in this case, an artificially manufactured one, one may get a mismatch. Fix the issue by resorting to a usbnet utility function usbnet_get_endpoints(), usually reserved for this very problem. Check for endpoints and return early before proceeding further if any are missing.
