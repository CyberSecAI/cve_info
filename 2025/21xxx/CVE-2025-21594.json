    "description": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the pfe (packet forwarding engine) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series causes a port within a pool to be blocked leading to Denial of Service (DoS). In a DS-Lite (Dual-Stack Lite) and NAT (Network Address Translation) scenario, when crafted IPv6 traffic is received and prefix-length is set to 56, the ports assigned to the user will not be freed. Eventually, users cannot establish new connections. Affected FPC/PIC need to be manually restarted to recover.
