    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved HID intel-ish-hid Fix use-after-free issue in ishtp_hid_remove() The system can experience a random crash a few minutes after the driver is removed. This issue occurs due to improper handling of memory freeing in the ishtp_hid_remove() function. The function currently frees the `driver_data` directly within the loop that destroys the HID devices, which can lead to accessing freed memory. Specifically, `hid_destroy_device()` uses `driver_data` when it calls `hid_ishtp_set_feature()` to power off the sensor, so freeing `driver_data` beforehand can result in accessing invalid memory. This patch resolves the issue by storing the `driver_data` in a temporary variable before calling `hid_destroy_device()`, and then freeing the `driver_data` after the device is destroyed.",
