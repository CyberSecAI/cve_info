    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved gpiolib Fix crash on error in gpiochip_get_ngpios() The gpiochip_get_ngpios() uses chip_*() macros to print messages. However these macros rely on gpiodev to be initialised and set, which is not the case when called via bgpio_init(). In such a case the printing messages will crash on NULL pointer dereference. Replace chip_*() macros by the respective dev_*() ones to avoid such crash.",
