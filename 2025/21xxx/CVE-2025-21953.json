    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net mana cleanup mana struct after debugfs_remove() When on a MANA VM hibernation is triggered, as part of hibernate_snapshot(), mana_gd_suspend() and mana_gd_resume() are called. If during this mana_gd_resume(), a failure occurs with HWC creation, mana_port_debugfs pointer does not get reinitialized and ends up pointing to older, cleaned-up dentry. Further in the hibernation path, as part of power_down(), mana_gd_shutdown() is triggered. This call, unaware of the failures in resume, tries to cleanup the already cleaned up mana_port_debugfs value and hits the following bug [ 191.359296] mana 78700000.0 Shutdown was called [ 191.359918]",
