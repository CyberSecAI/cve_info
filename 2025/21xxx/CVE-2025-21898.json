  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ftrace Avoid potential division by zero in function_stat_show() Check whether denominator expression x * (x - 1) * 1000 mod {2^32, 2^64} produce zero and skip stddev computation in that case. For now dont care about rec->counter * rec->counter overflow because rec->time * rec->time overflow will likely happen earlier.",
