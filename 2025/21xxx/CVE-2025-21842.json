    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved amdkfd properly free gang_ctx_bo when failed to init user queue The destructor of a gtt bo is declared as void amdgpu_amdkfd_free_gtt_mem(struct amdgpu_device *adev, void **mem_obj) Which takes void** as the second parameter. GCC allows passing void* to the function because void* can be implicitly casted to any other types, so it can pass compiling. However, passing this void* parameter into the functions execution process(which expects void** and dereferencing void**) will result in errors.",
