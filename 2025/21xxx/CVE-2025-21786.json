    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved workqueue Put the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool The commit 68f83057b913(workqueue Reap workers via kthread_stop() and remove detach_completion) adds code to reap the normal workers but mistakenly does not handle the rescuer and also removes the code waiting for the rescuer in put_unbound_pool(), which caused a use-after-free bug reported by Cheung Wall. To avoid the use-after-free bug, the pools reference must be held until the detachment is complete. Therefore, move the code that puts the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool.",
