  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved eth bnxt return fail if interface is down in bnxt_queue_mem_alloc() The bnxt_queue_mem_alloc() is called to allocate new queue memory when a queue is restarted. It internally accesses rx buffer descriptor corresponding to the index. The rx buffer descriptor is allocated and set when the interface is up and its freed when the interface is down. So, if queue is restarted if interface is down, kernel panic occurs.
