    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved thermal/netlink Prevent userspace segmentation fault by adjusting UAPI header The intel-lpmd tool [1], which uses the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY attribute to receive HFI events from kernel space, encounters a segmentation fault after commit 1773572863c4 (thermal netlink Add the commands and the events for the thresholds). The issue arises because the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY raw value was changed while intel_lpmd still uses the old value. Although intel_lpmd can be updated to check the THERMAL_GENL_VERSION and use the appropriate THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY value, the commit itself is questionable. The commit introduced a new element in the middle of enum thermal_genl_attr, which affects many existing attributes and introduces potential risks and unnecessary maintenance burdens for userspace thermal netlink event users. Solve the issue by moving the newly introduced THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_TZ_PREV_TEMP attribute to the end of the enum thermal_genl_attr. This ensures that all existing thermal generic netlink attributes remain unaffected. [ rjw Subject edits ]",
