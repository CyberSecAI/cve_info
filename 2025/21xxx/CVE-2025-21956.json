    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Assign normalized_pix_clk when color depth = 14 [WHY & HOW] A warning message WARNING CPU 4 PID 459 at ... /dc_resource.c3397 calculate_phy_pix_clks+0xef/0x100 [amdgpu] occurs because the display_color_depth == COLOR_DEPTH_141414 is not handled. This is observed in Radeon RX 6600 XT. It is fixed by assigning pix_clk * (14 * 3) / 24 - same as the rests. Also fixes the indentation in get_norm_pix_clk. (cherry picked from commit 274a87eb389f58eddcbc5659ab0b180b37e92775)",
