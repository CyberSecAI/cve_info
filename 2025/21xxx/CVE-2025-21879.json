    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs fix use-after-free on inode when scanning root during em shrinking At btrfs_scan_root() we are accessing the inodes root (and fs_info) in a call to btrfs_fs_closing() after we have scheduled the inode for a delayed iput, and that can result in a use-after-free on the inode in case the cleaner kthread does the iput before we dereference the inode in the call to btrfs_fs_closing(). Fix this by using the fs_info stored already in a local variable instead of doing inode->root->fs_info.",
