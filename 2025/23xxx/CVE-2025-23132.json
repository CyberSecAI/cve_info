    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved f2fs quota fix to avoid warning in dquot_writeback_dquots() F2FS-fs (dm-59) checkpoint=enable has some unwritten data. ------------[ cut here ]------------ WARNING CPU 6 PID 8013 at fs/quota/dquot.c691 dquot_writeback_dquots+0x2fc/0x308 pc dquot_writeback_dquots+0x2fc/0x308 lr f2fs_quota_sync+0xcc/0x1c4 Call trace dquot_writeback_dquots+0x2fc/0x308 f2fs_quota_sync+0xcc/0x1c4 f2fs_write_checkpoint+0x3d4/0x9b0 f2fs_issue_checkpoint+0x1bc/0x2c0 f2fs_sync_fs+0x54/0x150 f2fs_do_sync_file+0x2f8/0x814 __f2fs_ioctl+0x1960/0x3244 f2fs_ioctl+0x54/0xe0 __arm64_sys_ioctl+0xa8/0xe4 invoke_syscall+0x58/0x114 checkpoint and f2fs_remount may race as below, resulting triggering warning in dquot_writeback_dquots(). atomic write remount - do_remount - down_write(&sb->s_umount) - f2fs_remount - ioctl - f2fs_do_sync_file - f2fs_sync_fs - f2fs_write_checkpoint - block_operations - locked = down_read_trylock(&sbi->sb->s_umount) fail to lock due to the write lock was held by remount - up_write(&sb->s_umount) - f2fs_quota_sync - dquot_writeback_dquots - WARN_ON_ONCE(!rwsem_is_locked(&sb->s_umount)) trigger warning because s_umount lock was unlocked by remount If checkpoint comes from mount/umount/remount/freeze/quotactl, caller of checkpoint has already held s_umount lock, calling dquot_writeback_dquots() in the context should be safe. So lets record task to sbi->umount_lock_holder, so that checkpoint can know whether the lock has held in the context or not by checking current w/ it. In addition, in order to not misrepresent caller of checkpoint, we should not allow to trigger async checkpoint for those callers mount/umount/remount/ freeze/quotactl.",
