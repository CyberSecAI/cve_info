    "description": "A flaw in Node.js 20s HTTP parser allows improper termination of HTTP/1 headers using `\\\\r\\\\n\\\\rX` instead of the required `\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n`. This inconsistency enables request smuggling, allowing attackers to bypass proxy-based access controls and submit unauthorized requests. The issue was resolved by upgrading `llhttp` to version 9, which enforces correct header termination. Impact * This vulnerability affects only Node.js 20.x users prior to the `llhttp` v9 upgrade.",
