    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi ath11k Clear affinity hint before calling ath11k_pcic_free_irq() in error path If a shared IRQ is used by the driver due to platform limitation, then the IRQ affinity hint is set right after the allocation of IRQ vectors in ath11k_pci_alloc_msi(). This does no harm unless one of the functions requesting the IRQ fails and attempt to free the IRQ. This results in the below warning WARNING CPU 7 PID 349 at kernel/irq/manage.c1929 free_irq+0x278/0x29c Call trace free_irq+0x278/0x29c ath11k_pcic_free_irq+0x70/0x10c [ath11k] ath11k_pci_probe+0x800/0x820 [ath11k_pci] local_pci_probe+0x40/0xbc The warning is due to not clearing the affinity hint before freeing the IRQs. So to fix this issue, clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling ath11k_pcic_free_irq() in the error path. The affinity will be cleared once again further down the error path due to code organization, but that does no harm. Tested-on QCA6390 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HST.1.0.1-05266-QCAHSTSWPLZ_V2_TO_X86-1",
