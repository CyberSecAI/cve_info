This vulnerability arises when TLS Session Tickets https//nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_session_ticket_key are used and/or the SSL session cache https//nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_session_cache are used in the default server and the default server is performing client certificate authentication. Note Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.",
