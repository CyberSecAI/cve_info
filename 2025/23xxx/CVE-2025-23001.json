An attacker can manipulate the Host header in HTTP requests, which may lead to phishing attacks, reset password, or cache poisoning. NOTE the Suppliers position is that the end user is supposed to edit the NGINX configuration template to set server_name (with this setting, Host header injection cannot occur).",
