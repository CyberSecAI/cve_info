    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bus mhi host Fix race between unprepare and queue_buf A client driver may use mhi_unprepare_from_transfer() to quiesce incoming data during the client drivers tear down. The client driver might also be processing data at the same time, resulting in a call to mhi_queue_buf() which will invoke mhi_gen_tre(). If mhi_gen_tre() runs after mhi_unprepare_from_transfer() has torn down the channel, a panic will occur due to an invalid dereference leading to a page fault. This occurs because mhi_gen_tre() does not verify the channel state after locking it. Fix this by having mhi_gen_tre() confirm the channel state is valid, or return error to avoid accessing deinitialized data. [mani added stable tag]",
