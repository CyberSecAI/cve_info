    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Teamcenter V14.1 (All versions), Teamcenter V14.2 (All versions), Teamcenter V14.3 (All versions < V14.3.0.14), Teamcenter V2312 (All versions < V2312.0010), Teamcenter V2406 (All versions < V2406.0008), Teamcenter V2412 (All versions < V2412.0004). The SSO login service of affected applications accepts user-controlled input that could specify a link to an external site. This could allow an attacker to redirect the legitimate user to an attacker-chosen URL to steal valid session data. For a successful exploit, the legitimate user must actively click on an attacker-crafted link.",
