    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved PCI vmd Make vmd_devcfg_lock a raw_spinlock_t type The access to the PCI config space via pci_opsread and pci_opswrite is a low-level hardware access. The functions can be accessed with disabled interrupts even on PREEMPT_RT. The pci_lock is a raw_spinlock_t for this purpose. A spinlock_t becomes a sleeping lock on PREEMPT_RT, so it cannot be acquired with disabled interrupts. The vmd_devcfg_lock is accessed in the same context as the pci_lock. Make vmd_devcfg_lock a raw_spinlock_t type so it can be used with interrupts disabled. This was reported as BUG sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c48 Call Trace rt_spin_lock+0x4e/0x130 vmd_pci_read+0x8d/0x100 [vmd] pci_user_read_config_byte+0x6f/0xe0 pci_read_config+0xfe/0x290 sysfs_kf_bin_read+0x68/0x90 [bigeasy reword commit message] Tested-off-by Luis Claudio R.
