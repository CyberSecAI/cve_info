The underlying Python script, shell-connect.py, is vulnerable to command injection through the user argument. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. Exploitation Status Versa Networks is not aware of any reported instance where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been disclosed by third party security researchers. Workarounds or Mitigation There are no workarounds to disable the GUI option. Versa recommends that Director be upgraded to one of the remediated software versions.",
