    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved thermal int340x Add NULL check for adev Not all devices have an ACPI companion fwnode, so adev might be NULL. This is similar to the commit cd2fd6eab480 (platform/x86 int3472 Check for adev == NULL). Add a check for adev not being set and return -ENODEV in that case to avoid a possible NULL pointer deref in int3402_thermal_probe(). Note, under the same directory, int3400_thermal_probe() has such a check. [ rjw Subject edit, added Fixes ]",
