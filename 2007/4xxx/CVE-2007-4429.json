    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Skype allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server hang) via unknown vectors related to sending long URIs, as claimed to be actively exploited on 20070817 using a call to a specific number. NOTE this identifier is for the en.securitylab.ru disclosure. According to the vendor, this issue is separate from the sign-on issues that reduced Skype service on 20070817, which appears to be a site-specific problem. As of 20070821, it is not clear whether this issue is simply a symptom of the larger sign-on problem.",
