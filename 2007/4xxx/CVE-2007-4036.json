    "description": "Guidance Software EnCase allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service via (1) a corrupted Microsoft Exchange database, which triggers an application crash when many options are selected (2) a corrupted NTFS filesystem, which causes the application to report memory allocation errors or (3) deeply nested directories, which trigger an application crash during an Expand All action. NOTE the vendor disputes the significance of these vectors because the user can select fewer options, there is no operational impact, or the user can do less expansion",
