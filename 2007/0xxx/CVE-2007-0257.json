    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the expand_stack function in grsecurity PaX allows local users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors. NOTE the grsecurity developer has disputed this issue, stating that the function they claim the vulnerability to be in is a trivial function, which can, and has been, easily checked for any supposed vulnerabilities. The developer also cites a past disclosure that was not proven. As of 20070120, the original researcher has released demonstration code",
