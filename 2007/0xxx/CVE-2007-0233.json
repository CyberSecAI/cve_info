    "description": "wp-trackback.php in WordPress 2.0.6 and earlier does not properly unset variables when the input data includes a numeric parameter with a value matching an alphanumeric parameters hash value, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the tb_id parameter. NOTE it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix should be in PHP if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in WordPress.",
