NOTE Oracle has not disputed reliable researcher claims that DB08 is for a buffer overflow in the GET_OBJECT_NAME procedure in the DBMS_LOGREP_UTIL package, and DB09 is for buffer overflows in the CREATE_CAPTURE, ALTER_CAPTURE, and ABORT_TABLE_INSTANTIATION procedures in SYS.DBMS_CAPTURE_ADM_INTERNAL.",
