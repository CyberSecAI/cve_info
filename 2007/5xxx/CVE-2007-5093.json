    "description": "The disconnect method in the Philips USB Webcam (pwc) driver in Linux kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.22.6 relies on user space to close the device, which allows user-assisted local attackers to cause a denial of service (USB subsystem hang and CPU consumption in khubd) by not closing the device after the disconnect is invoked. NOTE this rarely crosses privilege boundaries, unless the attacker can convince the victim to unplug the affected device.",
