    "description": "The reply function in ftpd.c in the gssftp ftpd in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) does not initialize the length variable when auth_type has a certain value, which has unknown impact and remote authenticated attack vectors. NOTE the original disclosure misidentifies the conditions under which the uninitialized variable is used. NOTE the vendor disputes this issue, stating The length variable is only uninitialized if auth_type is neither the KERBEROS_V4 nor GSSAPI this condition cannot occur in the unmodified source code.",
