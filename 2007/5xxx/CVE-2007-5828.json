    "description": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the admin panel in Django 0.96 allows remote attackers to change passwords of arbitrary users via a request to admin/auth/user/1/password/. NOTE this issue has been disputed by Debian, since product documentation includes a recommendation for a CSRF protection module that is included with the product. However, CVE considers this an issue because the default configuration does not use this module",
