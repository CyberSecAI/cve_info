    "description": "The Thomson/Alcatel SpeedTouch 7G router, as used for the BT Home Hub 6.2.6.B and earlier, allows remote attackers on an intranet to bypass authentication and gain administrative access via vectors including a / (slash) character at the end of the PATH_INFO to cgi/b, aka double-slash auth bypass. NOTE remote attackers outside the intranet can exploit this by leveraging a separate CSRF vulnerability. NOTE SpeedTouch 780 might also be affected by some of these issues.",
