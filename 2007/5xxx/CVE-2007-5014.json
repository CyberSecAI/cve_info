  "description": "Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in pSlash 0.70 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in (1) the lvc_admin_dir parameter to modules/visitors2/admin/view-archiver.inc.php or (2) the lvc_include_dir parameter to modules/visitors2/include/menus.inc.php. NOTE the modules/visitors2/include/config.inc.php vector is already covered by CVE-2006-4373. NOTE vector 1 is disputed by CVE because PHP encounters a fatal instantiation error on a direct request for the file, before reaching the include statement.",
