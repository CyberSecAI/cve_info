    "description": "The CryptGenRandom function in Microsoft Windows 2000 generates predictable values, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to reduce the effectiveness of cryptographic mechanisms, as demonstrated by attacks on (1) forward security and (2) backward security, related to use of eight instances of the RC4 cipher, and possibly a related issue to CVE-2007-3898.",
