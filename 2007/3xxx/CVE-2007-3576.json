  "description": "Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 executes web script from URIs of arbitrary scheme names ending with the script character sequence, using the (1) vbscript handler for scheme names with 7 through 9 characters, and the (2) javascript handler for scheme names with 10 or more characters, which might allow remote attackers to bypass certain XSS protection schemes. NOTE other researchers dispute the significance of this issue, stating this only works when typed in the address bar.",
