    "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the random number generator (RNG) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22 might allow local root users to cause a denial of service or gain privileges by setting the default wakeup threshold to a value greater than the output pool size, which triggers writing random numbers to the stack by the pool transfer function involving bound check ordering. NOTE this issue might only cross privilege boundaries in environments that have granular assignment of privileges for root.",
