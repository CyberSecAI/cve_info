    "description": "suexec in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.2.3 uses a partial comparison for verifying whether the current directory is within the document root, which might allow local users to perform unauthorized operations on incorrect directories, as demonstrated using html_backup and htmleditor under an html directory. NOTE the researcher, who is reliable, claims that the vendor disputes the issue because the attacks described rely on an insecure server configuration in which the user has write access to the document root.",
