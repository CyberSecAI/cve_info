  "description": "The resource system in PHP 5.0.0 through 5.2.1 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code by interrupting the hash_update_file function via a userspace (1) error or (2) stream handler, which can then be used to destroy and modify internal resources. NOTE it was later reported that PHP 5.2 through 5.2.13 and 5.3 through 5.3.2 are also affected.",
