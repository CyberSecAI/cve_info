    "description": "Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in AFFLIB before 2.2.6 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a long LastModified value in an S3 XML response in lib/s3.cpp (2) a long (a) path or (b) bucket in an S3 URL in lib/vnode_s3.cpp or (3) a long (c) EFW, (d) AFD, or (c) aimage file path. NOTE the aimage vector (3c) has since been recalled from the researchers original advisory, since the code is not called in any version of AFFLIB.",
