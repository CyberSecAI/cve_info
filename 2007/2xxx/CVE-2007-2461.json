    "description": "The DHCP relay agent in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and PIX 7.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (dropped packets) via a DHCPREQUEST or DHCPINFORM message that causes multiple DHCPACK messages to be sent from DHCP servers to the agent, which consumes the memory allocated for a local buffer. NOTE this issue only occurs when multiple DHCP servers are used.",
