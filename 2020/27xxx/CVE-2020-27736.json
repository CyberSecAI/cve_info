The DNS domain name label parsing functionality does not properly validate the null-terminated name in DNS-responses. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a read past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition or leak the read memory.",
