  "description": "The elasticsearch-operator does not validate the namespace where kibana logging resource is created and due to that it is possible to replace the original openshift-logging console link (kibana console) to different one, created based on the new CR for the new kibana resource. This could lead to an arbitrary URL redirection or the openshift-logging console link damage. This flaw affects elasticsearch-operator-container versions before 4.7.",
