    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.1.0.1), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.1.0.1). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing of HPG files. This could result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to access data in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-12207)",
