    "description": "The FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.35.0 was not properly attributing various user actions to a specific users IP address. Instead, for various actions, it would report the IP address of an internal Wikimedia Foundation server by omitting X-Forwarded-For data. This resulted in an inability to properly audit and attribute various user actions performed via the FileImporter extension.",
