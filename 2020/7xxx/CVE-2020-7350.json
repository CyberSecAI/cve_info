    "description": "Rapid7 Metasploit Framework versions before 5.0.85 suffers from an instance of CWE-78 OS Command Injection, wherein the libnotify plugin accepts untrusted user-supplied data via a remote computers hostname or service name. An attacker can create a specially-crafted hostname or service name to be imported by Metasploit from a variety of sources and trigger a command injection on the operators terminal. Note, only the Metasploit Framework and products that expose the plugin system is susceptible to this issue -- notably, this does not include Rapid7 Metasploit Pro. Also note, this vulnerability cannot be triggered through a normal scan operation -- the attacker would have to supply a file that is processed with the db_import command.",
