  "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Parallels Desktop 15.1.4 (47270). An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the prl_hypervisor kext. By examining a log file, an attacker can disclose a memory address. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-11063.",
