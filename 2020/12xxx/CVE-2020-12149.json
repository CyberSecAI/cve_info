    "description": "The configuration backup/restore function in Silver Peak Unity ECOSTM (ECOS) appliance software was found to directly incorporate the user-controlled config filename in a subsequent shell command, allowing an attacker to manipulate the resulting command by injecting valid OS command input.

This affects all ECOS versions prior to 8.1.9.15, 8.3.0.8, 8.3.1.2, 8.3.2.0, 9.0.2.0, and 9.1.0.0.",
