    "description": "MailMate before 1.11 automatically imported S/MIME certificates and thereby silently replaced existing ones. This allowed a man-in-the-middle attacker to obtain an email-validated S/MIME certificate from a trusted CA and replace the public key of the entity to be impersonated. This enabled the attacker to decipher further communication. The entire attack could be accomplished by sending a single email.",
