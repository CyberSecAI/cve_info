    "description": "Unnecessary fields in the OpenTrace/BlueTrace protocol in COVIDSafe through v1.0.17 allow a remote attacker to identify a device model by observing cleartext payload data. This allows re-identification of devices, especially less common phone models or those in low-density situations.",
