    "description": "Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by lack of access control at the function level. This affects JGS516PE before 2.6.0.48, JGS524Ev2 before 2.6.0.48, JGS524PE before 2.6.0.48, and GS116Ev2 before 2.6.0.48. The TFTP firmware update mechanism does not properly implement firmware validations, allowing remote attackers to write arbitrary data to internal memory.",
