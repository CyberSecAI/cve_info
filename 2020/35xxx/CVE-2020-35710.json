    "description": "Parallels Remote Application Server (RAS) 18 allows remote attackers to discover an intranet IP address because submission of the login form (even with blank credentials) provides this address to the attackers client for use as a host value. In other words, after an attackers web browser sent a request to the login form, it would automatically send a second request to a RASHTML5Gateway/socket.io URI with something like host192.168.###.### in the POST data.",
