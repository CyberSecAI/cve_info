    "description": "A flaw was found in cairos image-compositor.c in all versions prior to 1.17.4. This flaw allows an attacker who can provide a crafted input file to cairos image-compositor (for example, by convincing a user to open a file in an application using cairo, or if an application uses cairo on untrusted input) to cause a stack buffer overflow -> out-of-bounds WRITE. The highest impact from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.",
