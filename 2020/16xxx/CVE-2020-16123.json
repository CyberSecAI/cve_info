    "description": "An Ubuntu-specific patch in PulseAudio created a race condition where the snap policy module would fail to identify a client connection from a snap as coming from a snap if SCM_CREDENTIALS were missing, allowing the snap to connect to PulseAudio without proper confinement. This could be exploited by an attacker to expose sensitive information. Fixed in 113.99.3-1ubuntu2, 113.99.2-1ubuntu2.1, 113.99.1-1ubuntu3.8, 111.1-1ubuntu7.11, and 18.0-0ubuntu3.15.",
