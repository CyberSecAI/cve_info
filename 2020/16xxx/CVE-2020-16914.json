    "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface Plus (GDI+) handles objects in memory, allowing an attacker to retrieve information from a targeted system. By itself, the information disclosure does not allow arbitrary code execution however, it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in combination with another vulnerability.To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how GDI+ handles memory addresses.",
