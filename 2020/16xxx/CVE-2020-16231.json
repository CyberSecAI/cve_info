    "description": "The affected Bachmann Electronic M-Base Controllers of version MSYS v1.06.14 and later use weak cryptography to protect device passwords. Affected controllers that are actively supported include MX207, MX213, MX220, MC206, MC212, MC220, and MH230 hardware controllers, and affected end-of-life controller include MC205, MC210, MH212, ME203, CS200, MP213, MP226, MPC240, MPC265, MPC270, MPC293, MPE270, and CPC210 hardware controllers. Security Level 0 is set at default from the manufacturer, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain access to the password hashes. Security Level 4 is susceptible if an authenticated remote attacker or an unauthenticated person with physical access to the device reads and decrypts the password to conduct further attacks.",
