    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows when the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs view, change, or delete data or create new accounts with full user rights.To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.",
