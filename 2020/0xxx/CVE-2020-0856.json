  "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Active Directory integrated DNS (ADIDNS) mishandles objects in memory. An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to read sensitive information about the target system.To exploit this condition, an authenticated attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the AD|DNS service. Note that the information disclosure vulnerability by itself would not be sufficient for an attacker to compromise a system. However, an attacker could combine this vulnerability with additional vulnerabilities to further exploit the system.The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Active Directory integrated DNS (ADIDNS) handles objects in memory.",
