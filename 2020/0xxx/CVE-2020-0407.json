    "description": "In various functions in fscrypt_ice.c and related files in some implementations of f2fs encryption that use encryption hardware which only supports 32-bit IVs (Initialization Vectors), 64-bit IVs are used and later are truncated to 32 bits. This may cause IV reuse and thus weakened disk encryption. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed.
