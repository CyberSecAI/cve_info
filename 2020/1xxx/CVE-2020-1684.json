    "description": "On Juniper Networks SRX Series configured with application identification inspection enabled, receipt of specific HTTP traffic can cause high CPU load utilization, which could lead to traffic interruption. Application identification is enabled by default and is automatically turned on when Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDP), AppFW, AppQoS, or AppTrack is configured. Thus, this issue might occur when IDP, AppFW, AppQoS, or AppTrack is configured. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D105 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D221, 15.1X49-D230 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R3-S3 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S3 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S2 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S1 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2.",
