    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Microsoft Windows processes group policy updates. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could potentially escalate permissions or perform additional privileged actions on the target machine.To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to launch a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack against the traffic passing between a domain controller and the target machine. An attacker could then create a group policy to grant administrator rights to a standard user.The security update addresses the vulnerability by enforcing Kerberos authentication for certain calls over LDAP.",
