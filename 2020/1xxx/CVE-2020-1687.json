    "description": "On Juniper Networks EX4300-MP Series, EX4600 Series and QFX5K Series deployed in (Ethernet VPN) EVPN-(Virtual Extensible LAN) VXLAN configuration, receipt of a stream of specific VXLAN encapsulated layer 2 frames can cause high CPU load, which could lead to network protocol operation issue and traffic interruption. This issue affects devices that are configured as a Layer 2 or Layer 3 gateway of an EVPN-VXLAN deployment. The offending layer 2 frames that cause the issue originate from a different access switch that get encapsulated within the same EVPN-VXLAN domain.
