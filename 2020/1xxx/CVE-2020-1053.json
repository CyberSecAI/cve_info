An attacker could then install programs view, change, or delete data or create new accounts with full user rights.To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how DirectX handles objects in memory.",
