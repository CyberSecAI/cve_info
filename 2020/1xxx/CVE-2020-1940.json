  "description": "The optional initial password change and password expiration features present in Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.2.0 to 1.22.0 are prone to a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability. The code mandates the changed password to be passed as an additional attribute to the credentials object but does not remove it upon processing during the first phase of the authentication. In combination with additional, independent authentication mechanisms, this may lead to the new password being disclosed.",
