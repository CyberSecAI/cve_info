An attacker could then install programs view, change, or delete data or create new accounts with full user rights.In a HTML editing attack scenario, an attacker could trick a user into editing a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability.The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how MSHTML engine validates input.",
