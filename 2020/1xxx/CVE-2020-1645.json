    "description": "When DNS filtering is enabled on Juniper Networks Junos MX Series with one of the following cards MS-PIC, MS-MIC or MS-MPC, an incoming stream of packets processed by the Multiservices PIC Management Daemon (mspmand) process, responsible for managing URL Filtering service, may crash, causing the Services PIC to restart. While the Services PIC is restarting, all PIC services including DNS filtering service (DNS sink holing) will be bypassed until the Services PIC completes its boot process.
