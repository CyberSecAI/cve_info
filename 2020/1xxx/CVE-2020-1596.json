    "description": "A information disclosure vulnerability exists when TLS components use weak hash algorithms. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise a userss encrypted transmission channel.To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how TLS components use hash algorithms.",
