    "description": "JamoDat TSMManager Collector version up to 6.5.0.21 is vulnerable to an Authorization Bypass because the Collector component is not properly validating an authenticated session with the Viewer. If the Viewer has been modified (binary patched) and the Bypass Login functionality is being used, an attacker can request every Collectors functionality as if they were a properly logged-in user administrating connected instances, reviewing logs, editing configurations, accessing the instances consoles, accessing hardware configurations, etc.Exploiting this vulnerability wont grant an attacker access nor control on remote ISP servers as no credentials is sent with the request.",
