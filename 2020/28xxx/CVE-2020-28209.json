    "description": "A CWE-428 Windows Unquoted Search Path vulnerability exists in EcoStruxure Building Operation Enterprise Server installer V1.9 - V3.1 and Enterprise Central installer V2.0 - V3.1 that could cause any local Windows user who has write permission on at least one of the subfolders of the Connect Agent service binary path, being able to gain the privilege of the user who started the service. By default, the Enterprise Server and Enterprise Central is always installed at a location requiring Administrator privileges so the vulnerability is only valid if the application has been installed on a non-secure location.",
