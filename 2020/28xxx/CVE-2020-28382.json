    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Solid Edge SE2020 (All Versions < SE2020MP12), Solid Edge SE2021 (All Versions < SE2021MP2). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files. This could result in a out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
