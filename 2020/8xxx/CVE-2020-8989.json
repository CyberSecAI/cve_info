    "description": "In the Voatz application 2020-01-01 for Android, the amount of data transmitted during a single voters vote depends on the different lengths of the metadata across the available voting choices, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover this voters choice by sniffing the network. For example, a small amount of sniffed data may indicate that a vote was cast for the candidate with the least metadata. An active man-in-the-middle attacker can leverage this behavior to disrupt voters abilities to vote for a candidate opposed by the attacker.",
