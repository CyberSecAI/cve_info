    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop 15.1.0-47107 . An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the VGA virtual device. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor. Was ZDI-CAN-9403.",
