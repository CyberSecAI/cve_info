    "description": "A buffer length validation vulnerability in Asylo versions prior to 0.6.0 allows an attacker to read data they should not have access to. The enc_untrusted_recvfrom function generates a return value which is deserialized by MessageReader, and copied into three different extents. The length of the third extents is controlled by the outside world, and not verified on copy, allowing the attacker to force Asylo to copy trusted memory data into an untrusted buffer of significantly small length.. We recommend updating Asylo to version 0.6.0 or later.",
