    "description": "Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 100, 200, and 300 series chipsets do not support encryption, allowing an attacker within radio range to take control of or cause a denial of service to a vulnerable device. An attacker can also capture and replay Z-Wave traffic. Firmware upgrades cannot directly address this vulnerability as it is an issue with the Z-Wave specification for these legacy chipsets. One way to protect against this vulnerability is to use 500 or 700 series chipsets that support Security 2 (S2) encryption. As examples, the Linear WADWAZ-1 version 3.43 and WAPIRZ-1 version 3.43 (with 300 series chipsets) are vulnerable.",
