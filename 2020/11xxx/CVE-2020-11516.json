  "description": "Stored XSS in the Contact Form 7 Datepicker plugin through 2.6.0 for WordPress allows authenticated attackers with minimal permissions to save arbitrary JavaScript to the plugins settings via the unprotected wp_ajax_cf7dp_save_settings AJAX action and the ui_theme parameter. If an administrator creates or modifies a contact form, the JavaScript will be executed in their browser, which can then be used to create new administrative users or perform other actions using the administrators session.",
