    "description": "An issue was discovered in USC iLab cereal through 1.3.0. It employs caching of stdshared_ptr values, using the raw pointer address as a unique identifier. This becomes problematic if an stdshared_ptr variable goes out of scope and is freed, and a new stdshared_ptr is allocated at the same address. Serialization fidelity thereby becomes dependent upon memory layout. In short, serialized stdshared_ptr variables cannot always be expected to serialize back into their original values. This can have any number of consequences, depending on the context within which this manifests.",
