  "description": "An issue was discovered in Responsive Filemanager through 9.14.0. In the dialog.php page, the session variable $_SESSION[RF][view_type] wasnt sanitized if it was already set. This made stored XSS possible if one opens ajax_calls.php and uses the view action and places a payload in the type parameter, and then returns to the dialog.php page. This occurs because ajax_calls.php was also able to set the $_SESSION[RF][view_type] variable, but there it wasnt sanitized.",
