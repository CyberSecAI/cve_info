    "description": "An issue was discovered in Deskpro before 2019.8.0. The /api/apps/* endpoints failed to properly validate a users privilege, allowing an attacker to control/install helpdesk applications and leak current applications configurations, including applications used as user sources (used for authentication). This enables an attacker to forge valid authentication models that resembles any user on the system.",
