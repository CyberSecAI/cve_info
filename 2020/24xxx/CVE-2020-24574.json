    "description": "The client (aka GalaxyClientService.exe) in GOG GALAXY through 2.0.41 (as of 1258 AM Eastern, 9/26/21) allows local privilege escalation from any authenticated user to SYSTEM by instructing the Windows service to execute arbitrary commands. This occurs because the attacker can inject a DLL into GalaxyClient.exe, defeating the TCP-based trusted client protection mechanism.",
