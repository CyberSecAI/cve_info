    "description": "Cerberus FTP Server Enterprise Edition prior to versions 11.0.3 and 10.0.18 allows an authenticated attacker to create files, display hidden files, list directories, and list files without the permission to zip and download (or unzip and upload) files. There are multiple ways to bypass certain permissions by utilizing the zip and unzip features. As a result, users without permission can see files, folders, and hidden files, and can create directories without permission.",
