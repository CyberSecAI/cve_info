    "description": "Sylius ResourceBundle accepts and uses any serialisation groups to be passed via a HTTP header. This might lead to data exposure by using an unintended serialisation group - for example it could make Shop API use a more permissive group from Admin API. Anyone exposing an API with ResourceBundles controller is affected. The vulnerable versions are =1.3.0 =1.4.0 =1.5.0 =1.6.0 <=1.6.2. The patch is provided for Sylius ResourceBundle 1.3.13, 1.4.6, 1.5.1 and 1.6.3, but not for any versions below 1.3.",
