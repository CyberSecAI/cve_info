    "description": "MX Player Android App versions prior to v1.24.5, are vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability when user is using the MX Transfer feature in Receive mode. An attacker can exploit this by connecting to the MX Transfer session as a sender and sending a MessageType of FILE_LIST with a name field containing directory traversal characters (../). This will result in the file being transferred to the victims phone, but being saved outside of the intended /sdcard/MXshare directory. In some instances, an attacker can achieve remote code execution by writing .odex and .vdex files in the oat directory of the MX Player application.",
