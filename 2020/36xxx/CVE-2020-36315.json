    "description": "In RELIC before 2020-08-01, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature forgery can occur because certain checks of the padding (and of the first two bytes) are inadequate. NOTE this requires that a low public exponent (such as 3) is being used. The product, by default, does not generate RSA keys with such a low number.",
