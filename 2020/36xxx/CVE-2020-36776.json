    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved thermal/drivers/cpufreq_cooling Fix slab OOB issue Slab OOB issue is scanned by KASAN in cpu_power_to_freq(). If power is limited below the power of OPP0 in EM table, it will cause slab out-of-bound issue with negative array index. Return the lowest frequency if limited power cannot found a suitable OPP in EM table to fix this issue.
