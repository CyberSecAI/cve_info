    "description": "An issue was discovered in Veritas CloudPoint before 8.3.0.1+hotfix. The CloudPoint Windows Agent leverages OpenSSL. This OpenSSL library attempts to load the \\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file, which does not exist. By default, on Windows systems users can create directories under \\. A low privileged user can create a \\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, which may result in arbitrary code execution. This would give the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all installed applications, etc.",
