    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/nouveau avoid a use-after-free when BO init fails nouveau_bo_init() is backed by ttm_bo_init() and ferries its return code back to the caller. On failures, ttm_bo_init() invokes the provided destructor which should de-initialize and free the memory. Thus, when nouveau_bo_init() returns an error the gem object has already been released and the memory freed by nouveau_bo_del_ttm().",
