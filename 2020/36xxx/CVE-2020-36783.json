    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i2c img-scb fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on return in functions img_i2c_xfer and img_i2c_init. However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment the PM reference count even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result in a reference leak here. Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage counter balanced.",
