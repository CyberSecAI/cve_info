    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net_sched keep alloc_hash updated after hash allocation In commit 599be01ee567 (net_sched fix an OOB access in cls_tcindex) I moved cp->hash calculation before the first tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash(), but cp->alloc_hash is left untouched. This difference could lead to another out of bound access. cp->alloc_hash should always be the size allocated, we should update it after this tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash().",
