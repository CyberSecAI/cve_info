    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i2c cadence fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on return in functions cdns_i2c_master_xfer and cdns_reg_slave. However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result in a reference leak here. Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage counter balanced.",
