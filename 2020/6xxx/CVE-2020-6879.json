    "description": "Some ZTE devices have input verification vulnerabilities. The devices support configuring a static prefix through the web management page. The restriction of the front-end code can be bypassed by constructing a POST request message and sending the request to the creation of a static routing rule configuration interface. The WEB service backend fails to effectively verify the abnormal input. As a result, the attacker can successfully use the vulnerability to tamper parameter values. This affects ZXHN Z500 V1.0.0.2B1.1000 and ZXHN F670L V1.1.10P1N2E. This is fixed in ZXHN Z500 V1.0.1.1B1.1000 and ZXHN F670L V1.1.10P2N2.",
