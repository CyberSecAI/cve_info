    "description": "An arbitrary code execution vulnerability exists in the rendering functionality of Nitro Software, Inc.s Nitro Pro 13.13.2.242. When drawing the contents of a page using colors from an indexed colorspace, the application can miscalculate the size of a buffer when allocating space for its colors. When using this allocated buffer, the application can write outside its bounds and cause memory corruption which can lead to code execution. A specially crafted document must be loaded by a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.",
