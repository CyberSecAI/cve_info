    "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE 7u271, 8u261, 11.0.8 and 15 Java SE Embedded 8u261. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.1 Base Score 3.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.1/AVN/ACH/PRN/UIR/SU/CL/IN/AN).",
