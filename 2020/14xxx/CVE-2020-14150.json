    "description": "GNU Bison before 3.5.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash). NOTE there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and an observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug reports were intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.",
