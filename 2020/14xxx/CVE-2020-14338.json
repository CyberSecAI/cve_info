    "description": "A flaw was found in Wildflys implementation of Xerces, specifically in the way the XMLSchemaValidator class in the JAXP component of Wildfly enforced the use-grammar-pool-only feature. This flaw allows a specially-crafted XML file to manipulate the validation process in certain cases. This issue is the same flaw as CVE-2020-14621, which affected OpenJDK, and uses a similar code. This flaw affects all Xerces JBoss versions before 2.12.0.SP3.",
