The request to download a plugin from the marketplace is only available to admin users and it isnt CSRF protected in components/market/controller.php. This might cause admins to make a vulnerable request without them knowing and result in remote code execution. NOTE the vendor states Codiad is no longer under active maintenance by core contributors.",
