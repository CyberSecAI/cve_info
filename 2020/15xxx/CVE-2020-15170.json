    "description": "apollo-adminservice before version 1.7.1 does not implement access controls. If users expose apollo-adminservice to internet(which is not recommended), there are potential security issues since apollo-adminservice is designed to work in intranet and it doesnt have access control built-in. Malicious hackers may access apollo-adminservice apis directly to access/edit the applications configurations. To fix the potential issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that do not expose apollo-adminservice to internet.",
