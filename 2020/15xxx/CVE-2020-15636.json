    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6400, R6700, R7000, R7850, R7900, R8000, RS400, and XR300 routers with firmware 1.0.4.84_10.0.58. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the check_ra service. A crafted raePolicyVersion in a RAE_Policy.json file can trigger an overflow of a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-9852.",
