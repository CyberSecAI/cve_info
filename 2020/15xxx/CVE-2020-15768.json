  "description": "An issue was discovered in Gradle Enterprise 2017.3 - 2020.2.4 and Gradle Enterprise Build Cache Node 1.0 - 9.2. Unrestricted HTTP header reflection in Gradle Enterprise allows remote attackers to obtain authentication cookies, if they are able to discover a separate XSS vulnerability. This potentially allows an attacker to impersonate another user. Gradle Enterprise affected application request paths/info/headers, /cache-info/headers, /admin-info/headers, /distribution-broker-info/headers. Gradle Enterprise Build Cache Node affected application request paths/cache-node-info/headers.",
