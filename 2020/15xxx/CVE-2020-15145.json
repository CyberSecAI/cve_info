    "description": "In Composer-Setup for Windows before version 6.0.0, if the developers computer is shared with other users, a local attacker may be able to exploit the following scenarios. 1. A local regular user may modify the existing `C\\ProgramData\\ComposerSetup\\bin\\composer.bat` in order to get elevated command execution when composer is run by an administrator. 2. A local regular user may create a specially crafted dll in the `C\\ProgramData\\ComposerSetup\\bin` folder in order to get Local System privileges. See https//itm4n.github.io/windows-server-netman-dll-hijacking. 3. If the directory of the php.exe selected by the user is not in the system path, it is added without checking that it is admin secured, as per Microsoft guidelines. See https//msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2018/04/04/triaging-a-dll-planting-vulnerability.",
