    "description": "In faye-websocket before version 0.11.0, there is a lack of certification validation in TLS handshakes. The `FayeWebSocketClient` class uses the `EMConnection#start_tls` method in EventMachine to implement the TLS handshake whenever a `wss` URL is used for the connection. This method does not implement certificate verification by default, meaning that it does not check that the server presents a valid and trusted TLS certificate for the expected hostname. That means that any `wss` connection made using this library is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, since it does not confirm the identity of the server it is connected to. For further background information on this issue, please see the referenced GitHub Advisory. Upgrading `faye-websocket` to v0.11.0 is recommended.",
