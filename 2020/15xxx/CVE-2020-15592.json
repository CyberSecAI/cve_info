  "description": "SteelCentral Aternity Agent before 11.0.0.120 on Windows allows Privilege Escalation via a crafted file. It uses an executable running as a high privileged Windows service to perform administrative tasks and collect data from other processes. It distributes functionality among different processes and uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) primitives to enable the processes to cooperate. The remotely callable methods from remotable objects available through interprocess communication allow loading of arbitrary plugins (i.e., C# assemblies) from the %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%/Aternity Information Systems/Assistant/plugins directory, where the name of the plugin is passed as part of an XML-serialized object. However, because the name of the DLL is concatenated with the .\\plugins string, a directory traversal vulnerability exists in the way plugins are resolved.",
