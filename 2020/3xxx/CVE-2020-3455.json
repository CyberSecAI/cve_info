    "description": "A vulnerability in the secure boot process of Cisco FXOS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to bypass the secure boot mechanisms. The vulnerability is due to insufficient protections of the secure boot process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting code into a specific file that is then referenced during the device boot process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to break the chain of trust and inject code into the boot process of the device which would be executed at each boot and maintain persistence across reboots.",
