    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Mobility Express Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user with an active session on an affected device to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions, including modifying the configuration, with the privilege level of the user.",
