    "description": "A vulnerability in the Live Data server of Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly manages resources when processing inbound Live Data traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple crafted Live Data packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to run out of buffer resources, which could result in a stack overflow and cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note The Live Data port in Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise devices allows only a single TCP connection. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to send crafted packets to an affected device before a legitimate Live Data client establishes a connection.",
