    "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco FXOS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrative credentials to cause a buffer overflow condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of values that are parsed from a specific file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted file that, when it is processed, may cause a stack-based buffer overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system with root privileges. An attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials to exploit this vulnerability.",
