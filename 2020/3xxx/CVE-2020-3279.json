    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Series Routers and Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, and RV082 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device. The vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input to scripts. An attacker with administrative privileges that are sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit each vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system.",
