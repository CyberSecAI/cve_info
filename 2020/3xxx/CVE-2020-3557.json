    "description": "A vulnerability in the host input API daemon of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper certificate validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted data stream to the host input daemon of the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the host input daemon to restart. The attacker could use repeated attacks to cause the daemon to continuously reload, creating a DoS condition for the API.",
