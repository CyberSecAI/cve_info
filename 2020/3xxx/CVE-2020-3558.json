The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting an HTTP request from a user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify the HTTP request to cause the interface to redirect the user to a specific, malicious URL. This type of vulnerability is known as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.",
