  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Prime Network Registrar (CPNR) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections in the web-based interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a targeted user, with an active administrative session on the affected device, to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to change the devices configuration, which could include the ability to edit or create user accounts of any privilege level. Some changes to the devices configuration could negatively impact the availability of networking services for other devices on networks managed by CPNR.",
