    "description": "A race condition due to insecure creation of a file in a temporary directory vulnerability in PAN-OS allows for root privilege escalation from a limited linux user account. This allows an attacker who has escaped the restricted shell as a low privilege administrator, possibly by exploiting another vulnerability, to escalate privileges to become root user. This issue affects PAN-OS 7.1 versions earlier than 7.1.26 PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.13 PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.6 All versions of PAN-OS 8.0.",
