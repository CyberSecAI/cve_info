    "description": "An information exposure through log file vulnerability where an administrators password or other sensitive information may be logged in cleartext while using the CLI in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software. The opcmdhistory.log file was introduced to track operational command (op-command) usage but did not mask all sensitive information. The opcmdhistory.log file is removed in PAN-OS 9.1 and later PAN-OS versions. Command usage is recorded, instead, in the req_stats.log file in PAN-OS 9.1 and later PAN-OS versions. This issue impacts PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.16 PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.10 PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3.",
