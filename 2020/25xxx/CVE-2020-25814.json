The attacker creates a message with [javascriptpayload xss] and turns it into a jQuery object with mw.message().parse(). The expected result is that the jQuery object does not contain an tag (or it does not have a href attribute, or its empty, etc.). The actual result is that the object contains an <a href =javascript... that executes when clicked.",
