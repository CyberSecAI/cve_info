  "description": "The DNS feature in InterNiche NicheStack TCP/IP 4.0.1 is affected by Buffer Overflow. The impact is execute arbitrary code (remote). The component is DNS response processing functions dns_upcall(), getoffset(), dnc_set_answer(). The attack vector is a specific DNS response packet. The code does not check the response data length field of individual DNS answers, which may cause out-of-bounds read/write operations, leading to Information leak, Denial-or-Service, or Remote Code Execution, depending on the context.",
