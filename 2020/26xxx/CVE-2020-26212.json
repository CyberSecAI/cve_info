    "description": "GLPI stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package, that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI before version 9.5.3, any authenticated user has read-only permissions to the planning of every other user, even admin ones. Steps to reproduce the behavior 1. Create a new planning with eduardo.mozart user (from IT group that belongs to Super-admin) into its personal planning at Assistance > Planning. 2. Copy the CalDAV url and use a CalDAV client (e.g. Thunderbird) to sync the planning with the provided URL. 3. Inform the username and password from any valid user (e.g. camila from Proativa group). 4. Camila has read-only access to eduardo.mozart personal planning. The same behavior happens to any group. E.g. Camila has access to IT group planning, even if she doesnt belong to this group and has a Self-service profile permission). This issue is fixed in version 9.5.3. As a workaround, one can remove the `caldav.php` file to block access to CalDAV server.",
