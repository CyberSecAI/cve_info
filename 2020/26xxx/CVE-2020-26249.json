By abusing this exploit, its possible to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive information. This high severity exploit has been fixed on version 0.1.7a. There are no workarounds, bot owners must upgrade their relevant packages (Dashboard module and Dashboard webserver) in order to patch this issue.",
