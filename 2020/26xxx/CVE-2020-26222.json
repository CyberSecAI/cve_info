    "description": "Dependabot is a set of packages for automated dependency management for Ruby, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Elixir, Rust, Java, .NET, Elm and Go. In Dependabot-Core from version 0.119.0.beta1 before version 0.125.1, there is a remote code execution vulnerability in dependabot-common and dependabot-go_modules when a source branch name contains malicious injectable bash code. For example, if Dependabot is configured to use the following source branch name /$({curl,127.0.0.1}), Dependabot will make a HTTP request to the following URL 127.0.0.1 when cloning the source repository. The fix was applied to version 0.125.1. As a workaround, one can escape the branch name prior to passing it to the DependabotSource class.",
