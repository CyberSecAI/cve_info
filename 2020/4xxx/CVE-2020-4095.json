    "description": "BigFix Platform is storing clear text credentials within the systems memory. An attacker who is able to gain administrative privileges can use a program to create a memory dump and extract the credentials. These credentials can be used to pivot further into the environment. The principle of least privilege should be applied to all BigFix deployments, limiting administrative access.",
