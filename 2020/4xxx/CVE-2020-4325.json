    "description": "The IBM Process Federation Server 18.0.0.1, 18.0.0.2, 19.0.0.1, 19.0.0.2, and 19.0.0.3 Global Teams REST API does not properly shutdown the thread pools that it creates to retrieve Global Teams information from the federated systems. As a consequence, the Java Virtual Machine cant recover the memory used by those thread pools, which leads to an OutOfMemory exception when the Process Federation Server Global Teams REST API is used extensively. IBM X-Force ID 177596.",
