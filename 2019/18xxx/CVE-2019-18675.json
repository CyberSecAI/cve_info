    "description": "The Linux kernel through 5.3.13 has a start_offset+size Integer Overflow in cpia2_remap_buffer in drivers/media/usb/cpia2/cpia2_core.c because cpia2 has its own mmap implementation. This allows local users (with /dev/video0 access) to obtain read and write permissions on kernel physical pages, which can possibly result in a privilege escalation.",
