    "description": "The BIOS configuration design on ASUS ROG Zephyrus M GM501GS laptops with BIOS 313 relies on the main battery instead of using a CMOS battery, which reduces the value of a protection mechanism in which booting from a USB device is prohibited. Attackers who have physical laptop access can exhaust the main battery to reset the BIOS configuration, and then achieve direct access to the hard drive by booting a live USB OS without disassembling the laptop. NOTE the vendor has apparently indicated that this is normal and use of the same battery for the BIOS and the overall system is a new design. However, the vendor apparently plans to improve this an unspecified later time",
