  "description": "The fetch API in Tightrope Media Carousel before 7.1.3 has CarouselAPI/v0/fetch?url= SSRF. This has two potential areas for abuse. First, a specially crafted URL could be used in a phishing attack to hijack the trust the user and the browser have with the website and could serve malicious content from a third-party attacker-controlled system. Second, arguably more severe, is the potential for an attacker to circumvent firewall controls, by proxying traffic, unauthenticated, into the internal network from the internet.",
