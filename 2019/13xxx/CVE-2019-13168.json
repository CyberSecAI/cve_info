    "description": "Some Xerox printers (such as the Phaser 3320 V53.006.16.000) were affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability in the attributes parser of the IPP service. This would allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) and potentially execute arbitrary code on the device.",
