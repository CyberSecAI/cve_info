  "description": "Because of a lack of sanitization around error messages, multiple Reflective XSS issues exist in iTop through 2.6.0 via the param_file parameter to webservices/export.php, webservices/cron.php, or env-production/itop-backup/backup.php. By default, any XSS sent to the administrator can be transformed to remote command execution because of CVE-2018-10642 (still working through 2.6.0) The Reflective XSS can also become a stored XSS within the same account because of another vulnerability.",
