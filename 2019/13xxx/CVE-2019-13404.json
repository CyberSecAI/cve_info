    "description": "The MSI installer for Python through 2.7.16 on Windows defaults to the C\\Python27 directory, which makes it easier for local users to deploy Trojan horse code. (This also affects old 3.x releases before 3.5.) NOTE the vendors position is that it is the users responsibility to ensure C\\Python27 access control or choose a different directory, because backwards compatibility requires that C\\Python27 remain the default for 2.7.x",
