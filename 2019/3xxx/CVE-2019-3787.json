    "description": "Cloud Foundry UAA, versions prior to 73.0.0, falls back to appending unknown.org to a users email address when one is not provided and the user name does not contain an @ character. This domain is held by a private company, which leads to attack vectors including password recovery emails sent to a potentially fraudulent address. This would allow the attacker to gain complete control of the users account.",
