    "description": "On SRX5000 Series devices, if set security zones security-zone tcp-rst is configured, the flowd process may crash when a specific TCP packet is received by the device and triggers a new session. The process restarts automatically. However, receipt of a constant stream of these TCP packets may result in an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 18.2R3 on SRX 5000 Series 18.4R2 on SRX 5000 Series 19.2R1 on SRX 5000 Series.",
