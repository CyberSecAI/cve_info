    "description": "An issue was discovered in WinRing0x64.sys in Moo0 System Monitor 1.83. The vulnerable driver exposes a wrmsr instruction via IOCTL 0x9C402088 and does not properly filter the Model Specific Register (MSR). Allowing arbitrary MSR writes can lead to Ring-0 code execution and escalation of privileges.",
