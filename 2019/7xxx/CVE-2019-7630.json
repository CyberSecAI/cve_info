    "description": "An issue was discovered in gdrv.sys in Gigabyte APP Center before 19.0227.1. The vulnerable driver exposes a wrmsr instruction via IOCTL 0xC3502580 and does not properly filter the target Model Specific Register (MSR). Allowing arbitrary MSR writes can lead to Ring-0 code execution and escalation of privileges.",
