    "description": "An issue was discovered in rcp in NetKit through 0.17. For an rcp operation, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rcp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned. A malicious rsh server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in a directory on the rcp client machine. This is similar to CVE-2019-6111.",
