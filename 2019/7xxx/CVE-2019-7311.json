  "description": "An issue was discovered on Linksys WRT1900ACS 1.0.3.187766 devices. A lack of encryption in how the user login cookie (admin-auth) is stored on a victims computer results in the admin password being discoverable by a local attacker, and usable to gain administrative access to the victims router. The admin password is stored in base64 cleartext in an admin-auth cookie. An attacker sniffing the network at the time of login could acquire the routers admin password. Alternatively, gaining physical access to the victims computer soon after an administrative login could result in compromise.",
