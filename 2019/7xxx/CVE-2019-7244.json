    "description": "An issue was discovered in kerneld.sys in AIDA64 before 5.99. The vulnerable driver exposes a wrmsr instruction via IOCTL 0x80112084 and does not properly filter the Model Specific Register (MSR). Allowing arbitrary MSR writes can lead to Ring-0 code execution and escalation of privileges.",
