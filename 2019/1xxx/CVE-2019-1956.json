  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based interface of the Cisco SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapter could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against another user of the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code in one of the configuration fields. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
