    "description": "A vulnerability in the Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol implementation in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect allocation of an internal interface index. An adjacent attacker with the ability to submit a crafted FCoE packet that crosses affected interfaces could trigger this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a packet loop and high throughput on the affected interfaces, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 7.3(5)N1(1).",
