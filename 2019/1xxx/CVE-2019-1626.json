The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly authorize certain user actions in the device configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the vManage Web UI and sending crafted HTTP requests to vManage. A successful exploit could allow attackers to gain elevated privileges and make changes to the configuration that they would not normally be authorized to make.",
