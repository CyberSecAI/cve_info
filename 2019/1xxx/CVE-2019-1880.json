    "description": "A vulnerability in the BIOS upgrade utility of Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) C-Series Rack Servers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to install compromised BIOS firmware on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the firmware image file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing the BIOS upgrade utility with a specific set of options. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the firmware signature-verification process and install compromised BIOS firmware on an affected device.",
