    "description": "An exploitable stack buffer overflow vulnerability vulnerability exists in the iocheckd service I/O-Check functionality of WAGO PFC 200 Firmware version 03.02.02(14). An attacker can send a specially crafted packet to trigger the parsing of this cache file. The destination buffer sp+0x440 is overflowed with the call to sprintf() for any hostname values that are greater than 1024-len(/etc/config-tools/change_hostname hostname=) in length. A hostname value of length 0x3fd will cause the service to crash.",
