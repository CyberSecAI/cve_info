    "description": "typed_ast 1.3.0 and 1.3.1 has a handle_keywordonly_args out-of-bounds read. An attacker with the ability to cause a Python interpreter to parse Python source (but not necessarily execute it) may be able to crash the interpreter process. This could be a concern, for example, in a web-based service that parses (but does not execute) Python code. (This issue also affected certain Python 3.8.0-alpha prereleases.)",
