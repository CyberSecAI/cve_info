    "description": "An issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.13.x before 1.13.5 and 1.14.x before 1.14.2. It doesnt sufficiently filter output when displaying content type names in the content creation interface. An attacker could potentially craft a specialized content type name, then have an editor execute scripting when creating content, aka XSS. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the Administer content types permission.",
