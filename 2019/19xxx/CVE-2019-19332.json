    "description": "An out-of-bounds memory write issue was found in the Linux Kernel, version 3.13 through 5.4, in the way the Linux kernels KVM hypervisor handled the KVM_GET_EMULATED_CPUID ioctl(2) request to get CPUID features emulated by the KVM hypervisor. A user or process able to access the /dev/kvm device could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of service.",
