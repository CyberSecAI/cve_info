    "description": "In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted btrfs filesystem image, performing some operations, and then making a syncfs system call can lead to a use-after-free in __mutex_lock in kernel/locking/mutex.c. This is related to mutex_can_spin_on_owner in kernel/locking/mutex.c, __btrfs_qgroup_free_meta in fs/btrfs/qgroup.c, and btrfs_insert_delayed_items in fs/btrfs/delayed-inode.c.",
