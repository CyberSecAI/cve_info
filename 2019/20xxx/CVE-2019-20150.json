    "description": "In TreasuryXpress 19191105, a logged-in user can discover saved credentials, even though the UI hides them. Using functionality within the application and a malicious host, it is possible to force the application to expose saved SSH/SFTP credentials. This can be done by using the applications editor to change the expected SFTP Host IP to a malicious host, and then using the Check Connectivity option. The application then sends these saved credentials to the malicious host.",
