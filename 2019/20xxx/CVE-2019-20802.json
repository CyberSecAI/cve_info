    "description": "An issue was discovered in the Readdle Documents app before 6.9.7 for iOS. The applications file-transfer web server improperly displays directory names, leading to Stored XSS, which may be used to steal a users data. This requires user interaction because there is no known direct way for an attacker to create a crafted directory name on a victims device. However, a crafted directory name can occur if a victim extracts a ZIP archive that was provided by an attacker.",
