    "description": "An issue was discovered in a smart contract implementation for MORPH Token through 2019-06-05, an Ethereum token. A typo in the constructor of the Owned contract (which is inherited by MORPH Token) allows attackers to acquire contract ownership. A new owner can subsequently obtain MORPH Tokens for free and can perform a DoS attack.",
