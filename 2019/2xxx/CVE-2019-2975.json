  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component Scripting). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE 8u221, 11.0.4 and 13 Java SE Embedded 8u221. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.8 (Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.0/AVN/ACH/PRN/UIN/SU/CN/IL/AL).",
