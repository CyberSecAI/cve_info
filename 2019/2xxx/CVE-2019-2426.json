  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE 7u201, 8u192 and 11.0.1 Java SE Embedded 8u191. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE accessible data. Note This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.7 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.0/AVN/ACH/PRN/UIN/SU/CL/IN/AN).",
