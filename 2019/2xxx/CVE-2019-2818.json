    "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE 11.0.3 and 12.0.1. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE accessible data. Note This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.0/AVN/ACH/PRN/UIR/SU/CL/IN/AN).",
