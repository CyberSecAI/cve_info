    "description": "Automattic Mongoose through 5.7.4 allows attackers to bypass access control (in some applications) because any query object with a _bsontype attribute is ignored. For example, adding _bsontypea can sometimes interfere with a query filter. NOTE this CVE is about Mongooses failure to work around this _bsontype special case that exists in older versions of the bson parser (aka the mongodb/js-bson project).",
