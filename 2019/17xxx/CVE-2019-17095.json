    "description": "A command injection vulnerability has been discovered in the bootstrap stage of Bitdefender BOX 2, versions 2.1.47.42 and 2.1.53.45. The API method `/api/download_image` unsafely handles the production firmware URL supplied by remote servers, leading to arbitrary execution of system commands. In order to exploit the condition, an unauthenticated attacker should impersonate a infrastructure server to trigger this vulnerability.",
