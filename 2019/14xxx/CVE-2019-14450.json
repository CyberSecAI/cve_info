  "description": "A directory traversal vulnerability was discovered in RepetierServer.exe in Repetier-Server 0.8 through 0.91 that allows for the creation of a user controlled XML file at an unintended location. When this is combined with CVE-2019-14451, an attacker can upload an external command configuration as a printer configuration, and achieve remote code execution. After exploitation, loading of the external command configuration is dependent on a system reboot or service restart.",
