    "description": "A flaw was found when an OpenSSL security provider is used with Wildfly, the enabled-protocols value in the Wildfly configuration isnt honored. An attacker could target the traffic sent from Wildfly and downgrade the connection to a weaker version of TLS, potentially breaking the encryption. This could lead to a leak of the data being passed over the network. Wildfly version 7.2.0.GA, 7.2.3.GA and 7.2.5.CR2 are believed to be vulnerable.",
