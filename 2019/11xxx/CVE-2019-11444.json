  "description": "An issue was discovered in Liferay Portal CE 7.1.2 GA3. An attacker can use Liferays Groovy script console to execute OS commands. Commands can be executed via a [command].execute() call, as demonstrated by def cmd = in the ServerAdminPortlet_script value to group/control_panel/manage. Valid credentials for an application administrator user account are required. NOTE The developer disputes this as a vulnerability since it is a feature for administrators to run groovy scripts and therefore not a design flaw",
