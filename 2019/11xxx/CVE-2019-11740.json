  "description": "Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 68, Firefox ESR 68, and Firefox 60.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
