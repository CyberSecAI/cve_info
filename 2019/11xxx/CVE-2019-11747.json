    "description": "The Forget about this site feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an http URL rather than secure https they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the sites HSTS setting will be restored. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
