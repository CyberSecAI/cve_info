This possibility is restricted to circumstances where HTTP Basic Authentication policy is used in conjunction with an XML Authentication resource. The BusinessWorks engine might instead use credentials from a prior HTTP request for authorization purposes. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc. TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks versions up to and including 6.4.2.",
