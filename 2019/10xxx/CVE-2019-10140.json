    "description": "A vulnerability was found in Linux kernels, versions up to 3.10, implementation of overlayfs. An attacker with local access can create a denial of service situation via NULL pointer dereference in ovl_posix_acl_create function in fs/overlayfs/dir.c. This can allow attackers with ability to create directories on overlayfs to crash the kernel creating a denial of service (DOS).",
