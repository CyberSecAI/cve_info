    "description": "An issue was discovered in Uniqkey Password Manager 1.14. When entering new credentials to a site that isnt registered within this product, a pop-up window will appear asking the user if they want to save these new credentials. The code of the pop-up window can be read and, to some extent, manipulated by remote servers. This pop-up window will stay on any page the user visits within the browser until a decision is made. A malicious web server can forcefully manipulate the pop-up and cause it not to appear, stopping users from securing their credentials. This vulnerability is related to id=uniqkey-password-popup and password-popup/popup.html, but is a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-10676.",
