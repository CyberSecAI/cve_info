    "description": "The virConnectGetDomainCapabilities() libvirt API, versions 4.x.x before 4.10.1 and 5.x.x before 5.4.1, accepts an emulatorbin argument to specify the program providing emulation for a domain. Since v1.2.19, libvirt will execute that program to probe the domains capabilities. Read-only clients could specify an arbitrary path for this argument, causing libvirtd to execute a crafted executable with its own privileges.",
