    "description": "The Wordfence plugin 7.2.3 for WordPress allows XSS via a unique attack vector. NOTE It has been asserted that this is not a valid vulnerability in the context of the Wordfence WordPress plugin as the firewall rules are not maintained as part of the Wordfence software but rather it is a set of rules hosted on vendor servers and pushed to the plugin with no versioning associated. Bypassing a WAF rule doesnt make a WordPress site vulnerable (speaking in terms of software vulnerabilities)",
