    "description": "An issue was discovered in SDCMS V1.7. In the \\app\\admin\\controller\\themecontroller.php file, the check_bad() functions filtering is not strict, resulting in PHP code execution. This occurs because some dangerous PHP functions (such as eval) are blocked but others (such as system) are not, and because .php is blocked but .PHP is not blocked.",
