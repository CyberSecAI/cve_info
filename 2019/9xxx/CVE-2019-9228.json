The (1) management SSH and (2) management TELNET features allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection slot exhaustion) via 5 unauthenticated connection attempts, because the maximum number of unauthenticated clients that can be configured is 5. NOTE the vendors position is that this is a design choice.",
