    "description": "In PostgreSQL 9.3 through 11.2, the COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM function allows superusers and users in the pg_execute_server_program group to execute arbitrary code in the context of the databases operating system user. This functionality is enabled by default and can be abused to run arbitrary operating system commands on Windows, Linux, and macOS. NOTE Third parties claim/state this is not an issue because PostgreSQL functionality for COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM is acting as intended. References state that in PostgreSQL, a superuser can execute commands as the server user without using the COPY FROM PROGRAM.",
