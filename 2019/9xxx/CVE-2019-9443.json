    "description": "In the Android kernel in the vl53L0 driver there is a possible out of bounds write due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local escalation of privilege due to a set_fs() call without restoring the previous limit with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
