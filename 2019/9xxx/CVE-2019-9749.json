    "description": "An issue was discovered in the MQTT input plugin in Fluent Bit through 1.0.4. When this plugin acts as an MQTT broker (server), it mishandles incoming network messages. After processing a crafted packet, the plugins mqtt_packet_drop function (in /plugins/in_mqtt/mqtt_prot.c) executes the memmove() function with a negative size parameter. That leads to a crash of the whole Fluent Bit server via a SIGSEGV signal.",
