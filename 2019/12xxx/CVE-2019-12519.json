    "description": "An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling the tag esiwhen when ESI is enabled, Squid calls ESIExpressionEvaluate. This function uses a fixed stack buffer to hold the expression while its being evaluated. When processing the expression, it could either evaluate the top of the stack, or add a new member to the stack. When adding a new member, there is no check to ensure that the stack wont overflow.",
