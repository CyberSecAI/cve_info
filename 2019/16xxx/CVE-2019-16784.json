  "description": "In PyInstaller before version 3.6, only on Windows, a local privilege escalation vulnerability is present in this particular case If a software using PyInstaller in onefile mode is launched by a privileged user (at least more than the current one) which have his TempPath resolving to a world writable directory. This is the case for example if the software is launched as a service or as a scheduled task using a system account (TempPath will be C\\Windows\\Temp). In order to be exploitable the software has to be (re)started after the attacker launch the exploit program, so for a service launched at startup, a service restart is needed (e.g. after a crash or an upgrade).",
