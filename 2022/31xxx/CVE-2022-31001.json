    "description": "Sofia-SIP is an open-source Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User-Agent library. Prior to version 1.13.8, an attacker can send a message with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, which may cause crash. This type of crash may be caused by `#define MATCH(s, m) (strncmp(s, m, n = sizeof(m) - 1) == 0)`, which will make `n` bigger and trigger out-of-bound access when `IS_NON_WS(s[n])`. Version 1.13.8 contains a patch for this issue.",
