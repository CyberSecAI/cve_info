    "description": "Concrete CMS Versions 9.0.0 through 9.0.2 and 8.5.7 and below can download zip files over HTTP and execute code from those zip files which could lead to an RCE. Fixed by enforcing concrete_secure instead of concrete. Concrete now only makes requests over https even a request comes in via http. Concrete CMS security team ranked this 8 with CVSS v3.1 vector AVN/ACH/PRH/UIN/SC/CH/IH/AH Credit goes to Anna for reporting HackerOne 1482520.",
