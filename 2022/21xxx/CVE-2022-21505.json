    "description": "In the linux kernel, if IMA appraisal is used with the ima_appraise=log boot param, lockdown can be defeated with kexec on any machine when Secure Boot is disabled or unavailable. IMA prevents setting ima_appraise=log from the boot param when Secure Boot is enabled, but this does not cover cases where lockdown is used without Secure Boot.
