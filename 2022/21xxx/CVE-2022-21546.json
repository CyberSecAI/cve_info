    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi target Fix WRITE_SAME No Data Buffer crash In newer version of the SBC specs, we have a NDOB bit that indicates there is no data buffer that gets written out. If this bit is set using commands like sg_write_same --ndob we will crash in target_core_iblock/files execute_write_same handlers when we go to access the se_cmd->t_data_sg because its NULL. This patch adds a check for the NDOB bit in the common WRITE SAME code because we dont support it. And, it adds a check for zero SG elements in each handler in case the initiator tries to send a normal WRITE SAME with no data buffer.",
