    "description": "go-cvss is a Go module to manipulate Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In affected versions when a full CVSS v2.0 vector string is parsed using `ParseVector`, an Out-of-Bounds Read is possible due to a lack of tests. The Go module will then panic. The problem is patched in tag `v0.4.0`, by the commit `d9d478ff0c13b8b09ace030db9262f3c2fe031f4`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may avoid this issue by parsing only CVSS v2.0 vector strings that do not have all attributes defined (e.g. `AVN/ACL/AuN/CP/IP/AC/EU/RLOF/RCC/CDPMH/TDH/CRM/IRM/ARM`). As stated in [SECURITY.md](https//github.com/pandatix/go-cvss/blob/master/SECURITY.md), the CPE v2.3 to refer to this Go module is `cpe2.3apandatixgo_cvss********`. The entry has already been requested to the NVD CPE dictionary.",
