    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Parasolid V33.1 (All versions = V33.1.262 = V35.0.161 < V35.0.164), Simcenter Femap V2022.1 (All versions < V2022.1.3), Simcenter Femap V2022.2 (All versions < V2022.2.2). The affected application is vulnerable to out of bounds read past the end of an allocated buffer when parsing X_T files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-18196)",
