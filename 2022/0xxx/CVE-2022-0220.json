  "description": "The check_privacy_settings AJAX action of the WordPress GDPR WordPress plugin before 1.9.27, available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users, responds with JSON data without an application/json content-type. Since an HTML payload isnt properly escaped, it may be interpreted by a web browser led to this endpoint. Javascript code may be executed on a victims browser. Due to v1.9.26 adding a CSRF check, the XSS is only exploitable against unauthenticated users (as they all share the same nonce)",
