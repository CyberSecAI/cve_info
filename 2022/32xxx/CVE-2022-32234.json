  "description": "An out of bounds write in hermes, while handling large arrays, prior to commit 06eaec767e376bfdb883d912cb15e987ddf2bda1 allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.",
