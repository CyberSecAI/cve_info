    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 block range must be validated before use in ext4_mb_clear_bb() Block range to free is validated in ext4_free_blocks() using ext4_inode_block_valid() and then its passed to ext4_mb_clear_bb(). However in some situations on bigalloc file system the range might be adjusted after the validation in ext4_free_blocks() which can lead to troubles on corrupted file systems such as one found by syzkaller that resulted in the following",
