    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved apparmor fix reference count leak in aa_pivotroot() The aa_pivotroot() function has a reference counting bug in a specific path. When aa_replace_current_label() returns on success, the function forgets to decrement the reference count of target, which is increased earlier by build_pivotroot(), causing a reference leak. Fix it by decreasing the refcount of target in that path.",
