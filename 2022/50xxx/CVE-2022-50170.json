    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved kunit executor Fix a memory leak on failure in kunit_filter_tests Its possible that memory allocation for filtered will fail, but for the copy of the suite to succeed. In this case, the copy could be leaked. Properly free copy in the error case for the allocation of filtered failing. Note that there may also have been a similar issue in kunit_filter_subsuites, before it was removed in kunit flatten kunit_suite*** to kunit_suite** in .kunit_test_suites.
