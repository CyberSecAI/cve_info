The hose_spinlock protects the phb_bitmap, and also the hose_list, but it doesnt need to be held while get_phb_number() calls the OF routines, because those are only looking up information in the device tree. So fix it by having get_phb_number() take the hose_spinlock itself, only where required, and then dropping the lock before returning. pcibios_alloc_controller() then needs to take the lock again before the list_add() but thats safe, the order of the list is not important.",
