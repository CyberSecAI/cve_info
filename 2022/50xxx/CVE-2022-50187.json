  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ath11k fix netdev open race Make sure to allocate resources needed before registering the device. This specifically avoids having a racing open() trigger a BUG_ON() in mod_timer() when ath11k_mac_op_start() is called before the mon_reap_timer as been set up. I did not see this issue with next-20220310, but I hit it on every probe with next-20220511. Perhaps some timing changed in between. Heres the backtrace [ 51.346947] kernel BUG at kernel/time/timer.c990! [ 51.346958] Internal error Oops - BUG 0",
