    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi rtw89 8852a rfk fix div 0 exception The DPK is a kind of RF calibration whose algorithm is to fine tune parameters and calibrate, and check the result. If the result isnt good enough, it could adjust parameters and try again. This issue is to read and show the result, but it could be a negative calibration result that causes divisor 0 and core dump. So, fix it by phy_div() that does division only if divisor isnt zero otherwise, zero is adopted. divide error 0000",
