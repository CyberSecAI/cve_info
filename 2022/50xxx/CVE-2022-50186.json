    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ath11k fix missing skb drop on htc_tx_completion error On htc_tx_completion error the skb is not dropped. This is wrong since the completion_handler logic expect the skb to be consumed anyway even when an error is triggered. Not freeing the skb on error is a memory leak since the skb wont be freed anywere else. Correctly free the packet on eid >= ATH11K_HTC_EP_COUNT before returning.
