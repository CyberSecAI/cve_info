    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved soundwire revisit driver bind/unbind and callbacks In the SoundWire probe, we store a pointer from the driver ops into the slave structure. This can lead to kernel oopses when unbinding codec drivers, e.g. with the following sequence to remove machine driver and codec driver. /sbin/modprobe -r snd_soc_sof_sdw /sbin/modprobe -r snd_soc_rt711 The full details can be found in the BugLink below, for reference the two following examples show different cases of driver ops/callbacks being invoked after the driver .remove(). kernel",
