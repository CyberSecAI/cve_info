    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iavf Fix NULL pointer dereference in iavf_get_link_ksettings Fix possible NULL pointer dereference, due to freeing of adapter->vf_res in iavf_init_get_resources. Previous commit introduced a regression, where receiving IAVF_ERR_ADMIN_QUEUE_NO_WORK from iavf_get_vf_config would free adapter->vf_res. However, netdev is still registered, so ethtool_ops can be called. Calling iavf_get_link_ksettings with no vf_res, will result with [ 9385.242676]",
