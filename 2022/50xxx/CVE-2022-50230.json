    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved arm64 set UXN on swapper page tables [ This issue was fixed upstream by accident in c3cee924bd85 (arm64 head cover entire kernel image in initial ID map) as part of a large refactoring of the arm64 boot flow. This simple fix is therefore preferred for -stable backporting ] On a system that implements FEAT_EPAN, read/write access to the idmap is denied because UXN is not set on the swapper PTEs. As a result, idmap_kpti_install_ng_mappings panics the kernel when accessing __idmap_kpti_flag. Fix it by setting UXN on these PTEs.",
