    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved stmmac intel Add a missing clk_disable_unprepare() call in intel_eth_pci_remove() Commit 09f012e64e4b (stmmac intel Fix clock handling on error and remove paths) removed this clk_disable_unprepare() This was partly revert by commit ac322f86b56c (net stmmac Fix clock handling on remove path) which removed this clk_disable_unprepare() because While unloading the dwmac-intel driver, clk_disable_unprepare() is being called twice in stmmac_dvr_remove() and intel_eth_pci_remove(). This causes kernel panic on the second call. However later on, commit 5ec55823438e8 (net stmmac add clocks management for gmac driver) has updated stmmac_dvr_remove() which do not call clk_disable_unprepare() anymore. So this call should now be called from intel_eth_pci_remove().",
