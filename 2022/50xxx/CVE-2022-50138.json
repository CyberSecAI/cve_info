    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/qedr Fix potential memory leak in __qedr_alloc_mr() __qedr_alloc_mr() allocates a memory chunk for mr->info.pbl_table with init_mr_info(). When rdma_alloc_tid() and rdma_register_tid() fail, mr is released while mr->info.pbl_table is not released, which will lead to a memory leak. We should release the mr->info.pbl_table with qedr_free_pbl() when error occurs to fix the memory leak.",
