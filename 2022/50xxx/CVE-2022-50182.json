    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media imx-jpeg Align upwards buffer size The hardware can support any image size WxH, with arbitrary W (image width) and H (image height) dimensions. Align upwards buffer size for both encoder and decoder. and leave the picture resolution unchanged. For decoder, the risk of memory out of bounds can be avoided. For both encoder and decoder, the driver will lift the limitation of resolution alignment. For example, the decoder can support jpeg whose resolution is 227x149 the encoder can support nv12 1080P, wont change it to 1920x1072.",
