    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter nf_tables do not allow SET_ID to refer to another table When doing lookups for sets on the same batch by using its ID, a set from a different table can be used. Then, when the table is removed, a reference to the set may be kept after the set is freed, leading to a potential use-after-free. When looking for sets by ID, use the table that was used for the lookup by name, and only return sets belonging to that same table. This fixes CVE-2022-2586, also reported as ZDI-CAN-17470.",
