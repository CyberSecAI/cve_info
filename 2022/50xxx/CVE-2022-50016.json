    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC SOF Intel cnl Do not process IPC reply before firmware boot It is not yet clear, but it is possible to create a firmware so broken that it will send a reply message before a FW_READY message (it is not yet clear if FW_READY will arrive later). Since the reply_data is allocated only after the FW_READY message, this will lead to a NULL pointer dereference if not filtered out. The issue was reported with IPC4 firmware but the same condition is present for IPC3.",
