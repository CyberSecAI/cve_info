    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved driversmdfix a potential use-after-free bug In line 2884, raid5_release_stripe(sh) drops the reference to sh and may cause sh to be released. However, sh is subsequently used in lines 2886 if (sh->batch_head && sh != sh->batch_head). This may result in an use-after-free bug. It can be fixed by moving raid5_release_stripe(sh) to the bottom of the function.",
