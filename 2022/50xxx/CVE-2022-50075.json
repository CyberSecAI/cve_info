    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tracing/eprobes Have event probes be consistent with kprobes and uprobes Currently, if a symbol @ is attempted to be used with an event probe (eprobes), it will cause a NULL pointer dereference crash. Both kprobes and uprobes can reference data other than the main registers. Such as immediate address, symbols and the current task name. Have eprobes do the same thing. For comm, if comm is used and the event being attached to does not have the comm field, then make it the $comm that kprobes has. This is consistent to the way histograms and filters work.",
