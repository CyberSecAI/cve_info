    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 avoid resizing to a partial cluster size This patch avoids an attempt to resize the filesystem to an unaligned cluster boundary. An online resize to a size that is not integral to cluster size results in the last iteration attempting to grow the fs by a negative amount, which trips a BUG_ON and leaves the fs with a corrupted in-memory superblock.",
