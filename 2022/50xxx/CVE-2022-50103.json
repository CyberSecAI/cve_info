  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sched, cpuset Fix dl_cpu_busy() panic due to empty cs->cpus_allowed With cgroup v2, the cpusets cpus_allowed mask can be empty indicating that the cpuset will just use the effective CPUs of its parent. So cpuset_can_attach() can call task_can_attach() with an empty mask. This can lead to cpumask_any_and() returns nr_cpu_ids causing the call to dl_bw_of() to crash due to percpu value access of an out of bound CPU value. For example",
