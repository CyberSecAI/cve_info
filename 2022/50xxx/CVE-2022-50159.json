    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved of check previous kernels ima-kexec-buffer against memory bounds Presently ima_get_kexec_buffer() doesnt check if the previous kernels ima-kexec-buffer lies outside the addressable memory range. This can result in a kernel panic if the new kernel is booted with mem=X arg and the ima-kexec-buffer was allocated beyond that range by the previous kernel. The panic is usually of the form below $ sudo kexec --initrd initrd vmlinux --append=mem=16G BUG Unable to handle kernel data access on read at 0xc000c01fff7f0000 Faulting instruction address 0xc000000000837974 Oops Kernel access of bad area, sig 11",
