    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/hfi1 fix potential memory leak in setup_base_ctxt() setup_base_ctxt() allocates a memory chunk for uctxt->groups with hfi1_alloc_ctxt_rcv_groups(). When init_user_ctxt() fails, uctxt->groups is not released, which will lead to a memory leak. We should release the uctxt->groups with hfi1_free_ctxt_rcv_groups() when init_user_ctxt() fails.",
