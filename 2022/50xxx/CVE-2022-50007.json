    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved xfrm fix refcount leak in __xfrm_policy_check() The issue happens on an error path in __xfrm_policy_check(). When the fetching process of the object `pols[1]` fails, the function simply returns 0, forgetting to decrement the reference count of `pols[0]`, which is incremented earlier by either xfrm_sk_policy_lookup() or xfrm_policy_lookup(). This may result in memory leaks. Fix it by decreasing the reference count of `pols[0]` in that path.",
