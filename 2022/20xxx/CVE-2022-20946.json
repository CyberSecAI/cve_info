    "description": "A vulnerability in the generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel decapsulation feature of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a memory handling error that occurs when GRE traffic is processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted GRE payload through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition. https//tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-gre-dos-hmedHQPM [https//tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-gre-dos-hmedHQPM] This advisory is part of the November 2022 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication.",
