  "cveId": "CVE-2022-20846",

  "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco&nbspDiscovery Protocol implementation for Cisco&nbspIOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the Cisco&nbspDiscovery Protocol process to reload on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a heap buffer overflow in certain Cisco&nbspDiscovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco&nbspDiscovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a heap overflow, which could cause the Cisco&nbspDiscovery Protocol process to reload on the device. The bytes that can be written in the buffer overflow are restricted, which limits remote code execution.Note Cisco&nbspDiscovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent). &nbspCisco&nbsphas released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.This advisory is part of the September 2022 release of the Cisco&nbspIOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.
