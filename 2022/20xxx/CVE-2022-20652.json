This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP message to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root-level privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid administrator-level credentials.Cisco&nbsphas released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
