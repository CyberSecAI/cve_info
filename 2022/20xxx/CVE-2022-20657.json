  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbspPI and Cisco&nbspEPNM could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.Cisco&nbsphas released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.",
