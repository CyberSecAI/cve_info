    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information. This vulnerability is due to missing authorization for certain resources in the web-based management interface together with insufficient entropy in these resource names. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of HTTPS requests to an affected device to enumerate resources on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the device.",
