  "description": "A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco&nbspAsyncOS for Cisco&nbspSecure Web Appliance, formerly Cisco&nbspWeb Security Appliance (WSA),&nbspcould allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection and elevate privileges to root. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the system and sending a crafted HTTP packet to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need at least read-only credentials.Cisco&nbsphas released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.Attention Simplifying the Cisco&nbspportfolio includes the renaming of security products under one brand Cisco&nbspSecure.
