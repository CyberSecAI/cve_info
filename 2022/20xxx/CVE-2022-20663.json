    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbspSecure Network Analytics, formerly Stealthwatch Enterprise, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.Cisco&nbsphas released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.Attention Simplifying the Cisco&nbspportfolio includes the renaming of security products under one brand Cisco&nbspSecure.
