    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Network Analytics, formerly Cisco Stealthwatch Enterprise, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands as an administrator on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands in the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make configuration changes on the affected device or cause certain services to restart unexpectedly.",
