    "description": "A vulnerability in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) message processing feature of Cisco Jabber could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to manipulate the content of XMPP messages that are used by the affected application. This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of nested XMPP messages within requests that are sent to the Cisco Jabber client software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an XMPP messaging server and sending crafted XMPP messages to an affected Jabber client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to manipulate the content of XMPP messages, possibly allowing the attacker to cause the Jabber client application to perform unsafe actions.",
