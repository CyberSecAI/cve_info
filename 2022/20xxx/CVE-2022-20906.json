    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation during CLI command execution on an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating as the rescue-user and executing vulnerable CLI commands using a malicious payload. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root on an affected device.",
