This vulnerability is due to unsanitized user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting custom JavaScript to the web application and persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.",
