  "description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` (in all backends such as XLA and handwritten kernels) is vulnerable to an integer overflow The result of this integer overflow is used to allocate the output tensor, hence we get a denial of service via a `CHECK`-failure (assertion failure), as in TFSA-2021-198. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.",
