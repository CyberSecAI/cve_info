    "description": "WD Discovery software executable files were signed with an unsafe SHA-1 hashing algorithm. An attacker could use this weakness to create forged certificate signatures due to the use of a hashing algorithm that is not collision-free. This could thereby impact the confidentiality of user content. This issue affects Western Digital WD Discovery WD Discovery Desktop App versions prior to 4.4.396 on Mac WD Discovery Desktop App versions prior to 4.4.396 on Windows.",
