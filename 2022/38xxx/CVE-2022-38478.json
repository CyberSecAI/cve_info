    "description": "Members the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 103, Firefox ESR 102.1, and Firefox ESR 91.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2, Thunderbird < 91.13, Firefox ESR < 91.13, Firefox ESR < 102.2, and Firefox < 104.",
