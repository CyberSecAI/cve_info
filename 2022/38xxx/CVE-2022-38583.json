    "description": "On versions of Sage 300 2017 - 2022 (6.4.x - 6.9.x) which are setup in a Windows Peer-to-Peer Network or Client Server Network configuration, a low-privileged Sage 300 workstation user could abuse their access to the SharedData folder on the connected Sage 300 server to view and/or modify the credentials associated with Sage 300 users and SQL accounts to impersonate users and/or access the SQL database as a system administrator. With system administrator-level access to the Sage 300 MS SQL database it would be possible to create, update, and delete all records associated with the program and, depending on the configuration, execute code on the underlying database server.",
