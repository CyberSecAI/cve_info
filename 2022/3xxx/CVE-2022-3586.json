  "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernels networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed) into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of service.",
