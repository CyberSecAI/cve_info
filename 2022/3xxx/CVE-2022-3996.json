    "description": "If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice recursively. On some operating systems (most widely Windows) this results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. Policy processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered to be a common setup. Policy processing is enabled by passing the `-policy argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() function. Update (31 March 2023) The description of the policy processing enablement was corrected based on CVE-2023-0466.",
