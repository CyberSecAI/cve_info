    "description": "When rendering certain unicode sequences, grub2s font code doesnt proper validate if the informed glyphs width and height is constrained within bitmap size. As consequence an attacker can craft an input which will lead to a out-of-bounds write into grub2s heap, leading to memory corruption and availability issues. Although complex, arbitrary code execution could not be discarded.",
