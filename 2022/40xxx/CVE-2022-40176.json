There exists an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command with root privileges during a restore operation due to the missing validation of the names of files included in the input package. By restoring a specifically crafted package, a remote low-privileged attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges on the device, leading to a full compromise.",
