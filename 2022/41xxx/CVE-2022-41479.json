    "description": "The DevExpress Resource Handler (ASPxHttpHandlerModule) in DevExpress ASP.NET Web Forms Build v19.2.3 does not verify the referenced objects in the /DXR.axd?r= HTTP GET parameter. This leads to an Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability which allows attackers to access the application source code. NOTE the vendor disputes this because the retrieved source code is only the DevExpress client-side application code that is, of course, intentionally readable by web browsers (a sites custom code and data is never accessible via an IDOR approach).",
