    "description": "An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712. Management protocol has a flow which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary Bash code with root privileges. The command that sets the hostname doesnt validate input parameters. As a result, arbitrary data goes directly to the Bash interpreter. An attacker would need credentials to exploit this vulnerability. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611.",
