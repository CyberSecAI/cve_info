    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix SAML (Mendix 7 compatible) (All versions < V1.17.0), Mendix SAML (Mendix 8 compatible) (All versions < V2.3.0), Mendix SAML (Mendix 9 compatible, New Track) (All versions < V3.3.1), Mendix SAML (Mendix 9 compatible, Upgrade Track) (All versions < V3.3.0). Affected versions of the module insufficiently protect from packet capture replay. This could allow unauthorized remote attackers to bypass authentication and get access to the application. For compatibility reasons, fix versions still contain this issue, but only when the not recommended, non default configuration option `Allow Idp Initiated Authentication` is enabled.",
