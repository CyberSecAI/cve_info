    "description": "With Apache Ivy 2.4.0 an optional packaging attribute has been introduced that allows artifacts to be unpacked on the fly if they used pack200 or zip packaging. For artifacts using the zip, jar or war packaging Ivy prior to 2.5.1 doesnt verify the target path when extracting the archive. An archive containing absolute paths or paths that try to traverse upwards using .. sequences can then write files to any location on the local fie system that the user executing Ivy has write access to. Ivy users of version 2.4.0 to 2.5.0 should upgrade to Ivy 2.5.1.",
