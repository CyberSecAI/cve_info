    "description": "Yet Another UserAgent Analyzer (Yauaa) is a java library that tries to parse and analyze the useragent string and extract as many relevant attributes as possible. Applications using the Client Hints analysis feature introduced with 7.0.0 can crash because the Yauaa library throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. If uncaught the exception will result in a program crash. Applications that do not use this feature are not affected. Users are advised to upgrade to version 7.9.0. Users unable to upgrade may catch and discard any ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException thrown by the Yauaa library.",
