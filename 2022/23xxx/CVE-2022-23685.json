    "description": "A vulnerability in the ClearPass Policy Manager web-based management interface exists which exposes some endpoints to a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. This could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary input against these endpoints if the attacker can convince an authenticated user of the interface to interact with a specially crafted URL in Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager version(s) 6.10.x 6.10.6 and below 6.9.x 6.9.11 and below. Aruba has released upgrades for Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager that address this security vulnerability.",
