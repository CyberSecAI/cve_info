    "description": "Xerox VersaLink devices on specific versions of firmware before 2022-01-26 allow remote attackers to brick the device via a crafted TIFF file in an unauthenticated HTTP POST request. There is a permanent denial of service because image parsing causes a reboot, but image parsing is restarted as soon as the boot process finishes. However, this boot loop can be resolved by a field technician. The TIFF file must have an incomplete Image Directory. Affected firmware versions include xx.42.01 and xx.50.61. NOTE the 2022-01-24 NeoSmart article included believed to affect all previous and later versions as of the date of this posting but a 2022-01-26 vendor statement reports the latest versions of firmware are not vulnerable to this issue.",
