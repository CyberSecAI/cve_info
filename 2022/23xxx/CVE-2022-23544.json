    "description": "MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform, covering test management, interface testing, UI testing and performance testing. Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceServicegetMdImageByUrl` allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript code in the context of Meterspheres origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds.",
