    "description": "NUUO NVRmini2 through 3.11 allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload an encrypted TAR archive, which can be abused to add arbitrary users because of the lack of handle_import_user.php authentication. When combined with another flaw (CVE-2011-5325), it is possible to overwrite arbitrary files under the web root and achieve code execution as root.",
