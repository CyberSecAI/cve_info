    "description": "rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in Rails applications. Prior to version 1.4.4, there is a possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of RailsHtmlSanitizer due to an incomplete fix of CVE-2022-32209. RailsHtmlSanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if the application developer has overridden the sanitizers allowed tags to allow both select and style elements. Code is only impacted if allowed tags are being overridden. This issue is patched in version 1.4.4. All users overriding the allowed tags to include both select and style should either upgrade or use this workaround Remove either select or style from the overridden allowed tags. NOTE Code is _not_ impacted if allowed tags are overridden using either the tags option to the Action View helper method sanitize or the tags option to the instance method SafeListSanitizer#sanitize.",
