    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of AOS-CX could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to fingerprint the exact version AOS-CX running on the switch. This allows an attacker to retrieve information which could be used to more precisely target the switch for further exploitation in ArubaOS-CX Switches version(s) AOS-CX 10.10.xxxx 10.10.0002 and below, AOS-CX 10.09.xxxx 10.09.1020 and below, AOS-CX 10.08.xxxx 10.08.1060 and below, AOS-CX 10.06.xxxx 10.06.0200 and below. Aruba has released upgrades for ArubaOS-CX Switch Devices that address this security vulnerability.",
