  "description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `RaggedBincount` is given an empty input tensor `splits`, it results in a segfault that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 7a4591fd4f065f4fa903593bc39b2f79530a74b8. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
