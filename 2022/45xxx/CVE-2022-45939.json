    "description": "GNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell metacharacters in the name of a source-code file, because lib-src/etags.c uses the system C library function in its implementation of the ctags program. For example, a victim may use the ctags * command (suggested in the ctags documentation) in a situation where the current working directory has contents that depend on untrusted input.",
