    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/i915/gt Cleanup partial engine discovery failures If we abort driver initialisation in the middle of gt/engine discovery, some engines will be fully setup and some not. Those incompletely setup engines only have engine->release == NULL and so will leak any of the common objects allocated. v2 - Drop the destroy_pinned_context() helper for now. Its not really worth it with just a single callsite at the moment. (Janusz)",
