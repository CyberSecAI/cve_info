    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/mlx5e IPoIB, Block PKEY interfaces with less rx queues than parent A user is able to configure an arbitrary number of rx queues when creating an interface via netlink. This doesnt work for child PKEY interfaces because the child interface uses the parent receive channels. Although the child shares the parents receive channels, the number of rx queues is important for the channel_stats array the parents rx channel index is used to access the childs channel_stats. So the array has to be at least as large as the parents rx queue size for the counting to work correctly and to prevent out of bound accesses. This patch checks for the mentioned scenario and returns an error when trying to create the interface. The error is propagated to the user.",
