    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved can af_can fix NULL pointer dereference in can_rcv_filter Analogue to commit 8aa59e355949 (can af_can fix NULL pointer dereference in can_rx_register()) we need to check for a missing initialization of ml_priv in the receive path of CAN frames. Since commit 4e096a18867a (net introduce CAN specific pointer in the struct net_device) the check for dev->type to be ARPHRD_CAN is not sufficient anymore since bonding or tun netdevices claim to be CAN devices but do not initialize ml_priv accordingly.",
