    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/khugepaged invoke MMU notifiers in shmem/file collapse paths Any codepath that zaps page table entries must invoke MMU notifiers to ensure that secondary MMUs (like KVM) dont keep accessing pages which arent mapped anymore. Secondary MMUs dont hold their own references to pages that are mirrored over, so failing to notify them can lead to page use-after-free. Im marking this as addressing an issue introduced in commit f3f0e1d2150b (khugepaged add support of collapse for tmpfs/shmem pages), but most of the security impact of this only came in commit 27e1f8273113 (khugepaged enable collapse pmd for pte-mapped THP), which actually omitted flushes for the removal of present PTEs, not just for the removal of empty page tables.",
