    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved gpio mockup fix NULL pointer dereference when removing debugfs We now remove the devices debugfs entries when unbinding the driver. This now causes a NULL-pointer dereference on module exit because the platform devices are unregistered *after* the global debugfs directory has been recursively removed. Fix it by unregistering the devices first.",
