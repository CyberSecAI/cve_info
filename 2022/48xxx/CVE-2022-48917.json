    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC ops Shift tested values in snd_soc_put_volsw() by +min While the $val/$val2 values passed in from userspace are always >= 0 integers, the limits of the control can be signed integers and the $min can be non-zero and less than zero. To correctly validate $val/$val2 against platform_max, add the $min offset to val first.",
