    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sched Fix yet more sched_fork() races Where commit 4ef0c5c6b5ba (kernel/sched Fix sched_fork() access an invalid sched_task_group) fixed a fork race vs cgroup, it opened up a race vs syscalls by not placing the task on the runqueue before it gets exposed through the pidhash. Commit 13765de8148f (sched/fair Fix fault in reweight_entity) is trying to fix a single instance of this, instead fix the whole class of issues, effectively reverting this commit.",
