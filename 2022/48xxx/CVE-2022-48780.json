    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/smc Avoid overwriting the copies of clcsock callback functions The callback functions of clcsock will be saved and replaced during the fallback. But if the fallback happens more than once, then the copies of these callback functions will be overwritten incorrectly, resulting in a loop call issue clcsk->sk_error_report |- smc_fback_error_report() clcsk_error_report() ------------------| So this patch fixes the issue by saving these function pointers only once in the fallback and avoiding overwriting.",
