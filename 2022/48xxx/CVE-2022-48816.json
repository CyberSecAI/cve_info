    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved SUNRPC lock against ->sock changing during sysfs read ->sock can be set to NULL asynchronously unless ->recv_mutex is held. So it is important to hold that mutex. Otherwise a sysfs read can trigger an oops. Commit 17f09d3f619a (SUNRPC Check if the xprt is connected before handling sysfs reads) appears to attempt to fix this problem, but it only narrows the race window.",
