  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net arc_emac Fix use after free in arc_mdio_probe() If bus->state is equal to MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED, mdiobus_free(bus) will free the bus. But bus->name is still used in the next line, which will lead to a use after free. We can fix it by putting the name in a local variable and make the bus->name point to the rodata section name,then use the name in the error message without referring to bus to avoid the uaf.",
