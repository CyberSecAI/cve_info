  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ice Fix crash by keep old cfg when update TCs more than queues There are problems if allocated queues less than Traffic Classes. Commit a632b2a4c920 (ice ethtool Prohibit improper channel config for DCB) already disallow setting less queues than TCs. Another case is if we first set less queues, and later update more TCs config due to LLDP, ice_vsi_cfg_tc() will failed but left dirty num_txq/rxq and tc_cfg in vsi, that will cause invalid pointer access.
