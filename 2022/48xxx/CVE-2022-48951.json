    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC ops Check bounds for second channel in snd_soc_put_volsw_sx() The bounds checks in snd_soc_put_volsw_sx() are only being applied to the first channel, meaning it is possible to write out of bounds values to the second channel in stereo controls. Add appropriate checks.",
