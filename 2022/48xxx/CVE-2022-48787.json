    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iwlwifi fix use-after-free If no firmware was present at all (or, presumably, all of the firmware files failed to parse), we end up unbinding by calling device_release_driver(), which calls remove(), which then in iwlwifi calls iwl_drv_stop(), freeing the drv struct. However the new code I added will still erroneously access it after it was freed. Set failure=false in this case to avoid the access, all data was already freed anyway.",
