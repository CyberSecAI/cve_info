    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net mscc ocelot fix use-after-free in ocelot_vlan_del() ocelot_vlan_member_del() will free the struct ocelot_bridge_vlan, so if this is the same as the ports pvid_vlan which we access afterwards, what were accessing is freed memory. Fix the bug by determining whether to clear ocelot_port->pvid_vlan prior to calling ocelot_vlan_member_del().",
