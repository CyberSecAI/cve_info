This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload injected into the Description or Welcome-message text fields. NOTE the vendor indicates that this is not a vulnerability because the manipulation requires Superadministrator privileges, and Superadministrators are already allowed to customize surveys with JavaScript as they wish.",
