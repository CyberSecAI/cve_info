    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/vmwgfx Fix stale file descriptors on failed usercopy A failing usercopy of the fence_rep object will lead to a stale entry in the file descriptor table as put_unused_fd() wont release it. This enables userland to refer to a dangling file object through that still valid file descriptor, leading to all kinds of use-after-free exploitation scenarios. Fix this by deferring the call to fd_install() until after the usercopy has succeeded.",
