    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved firmware arm_scmi Harden accesses to the reset domains Accessing reset domains descriptors by the index upon the SCMI drivers requests through the SCMI reset operations interface can potentially lead to out-of-bound violations if the SCMI driver misbehave. Add an internal consistency check before any such domains descriptors accesses.",
