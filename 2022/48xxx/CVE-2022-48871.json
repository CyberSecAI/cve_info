    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tty serial qcom-geni-serial fix slab-out-of-bounds on RX FIFO buffer Drivers probe allocates memory for RX FIFO (port->rx_fifo) based on default RX FIFO depth, e.g. 16. Later during serial startup the qcom_geni_serial_port_setup() updates the RX FIFO depth (port->rx_fifo_depth) to match real device capabilities, e.g. to 32. The RX UART handle code will read port->rx_fifo_depth number of words into port->rx_fifo buffer, thus exceeding the bounds. This can be observed in certain configurations with Qualcomm Bluetooth HCI UART device and KASAN Bluetooth hci0 QCA Product ID 0x00000010 Bluetooth hci0 QCA SOC Version 0x400a0200 Bluetooth hci0 QCA ROM Version 0x00000200 Bluetooth hci0 QCA Patch Version0x00000d2b Bluetooth hci0 QCA controller version 0x02000200 Bluetooth hci0 QCA Downloading qca/htbtfw20.tlv bluetooth hci0 Direct firmware load for qca/htbtfw20.tlv failed with error -2 Bluetooth hci0 QCA Failed to request file qca/htbtfw20.tlv (-2) Bluetooth hci0 QCA Failed to download patch (-2) ================================================================== BUG KASAN slab-out-of-bounds in handle_rx_uart+0xa8/0x18c Write of size 4 at addr ffff279347d578c0 by task swapper/0/0 CPU 0 PID 0 Comm swapper/0 Not tainted 6.1.0-rt5-00350-gb2450b7e00be-dirty #26 Hardware name Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
