    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Add schedule points in batch ops syzbot reported various soft lockups caused by bpf batch operations. INFO task kworker/1127 blocked for more than 140 seconds. INFO task hung in rcu_barrier Nothing prevents batch ops to process huge amount of data, we need to add schedule points in them. Note that maybe_wait_bpf_programs(map) calls from generic_map_delete_batch() can be factorized by moving the call after the loop. This will be done later in -next tree once we get this fix merged, unless there is strong opinion doing this optimization sooner.",
