    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mtd parsers qcom Fix kernel panic on skipped partition In the event of a skipped partition (case when the entry name is empty) the kernel panics in the cleanup function as the name entry is NULL. Rework the parser logic by first checking the real partition number and then allocate the space and set the data for the valid partitions. The logic was also fundamentally wrong as with a skipped partition, the parts number returned was incorrect by not decreasing it for the skipped partitions.",
