  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ALSA hda Fix UAF of leds class devs at unbinding The LED class devices that are created by HD-audio codec drivers are registered via devm_led_classdev_register() and associated with the HD-audio codec device. Unfortunately, it turned out that the devres release doesnt work for this case namely, since the codec resource release happens before the devm call chain, it triggers a NULL dereference or a UAF for a stale set_brightness_delay callback. For fixing the bug, this patch changes the LED class device register and unregister in a manual manner without devres, keeping the instances in hda_gen_spec.",
