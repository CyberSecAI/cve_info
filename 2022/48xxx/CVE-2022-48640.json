    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bonding fix NULL deref in bond_rr_gen_slave_id Fix a NULL dereference of the struct bonding.rr_tx_counter member because if a bond is initially created with an initial mode != zero (Round Robin) the memory required for the counter is never created and when the mode is changed there is never any attempt to verify the memory is allocated upon switching modes.
