    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net dsa ar9331 register the mdiobus under devres As explained in commits 74b6d7d13307 (net dsa realtek register the MDIO bus under devres) 5135e96a3dd2 (net dsa dont allocate the slave_mii_bus using devres) mdiobus_free() will panic when called from devm_mdiobus_free() remove on ->shutdown) do not apply. But there is one more which applies here. If the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown (like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device link between the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers() will unbind the ar9331 switch driver on shutdown. So the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, which is either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration, or dont use devres at all. The ar9331 driver doesnt have a complex code structure for mdiobus removal, so just replace of_mdiobus_register with the devres variant in order to be all-devres and ensure that we dont free a still-registered bus.",
