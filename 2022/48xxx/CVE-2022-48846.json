    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved block release rq qos structures for queue without disk blkcg_init_queue() may add rq qos structures to request queue, previously blk_cleanup_queue() calls rq_qos_exit() to release them, but commit 8e141f9eb803 (block drain file system I/O on del_gendisk) moves rq_qos_exit() into del_gendisk(), so memory leak is caused because queues may not have disk, such as un-present scsi luns, nvme admin queue, ... Fixes the issue by adding rq_qos_exit() to blk_cleanup_queue() back. BTW, v5.18 wont need this patch any more since we move blkcg_init_queue()/blkcg_exit_queue() into disk allocation/release handler, and patches have been in for-5.18/block.",
