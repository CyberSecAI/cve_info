    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ice Fix KASAN error in LAG NETDEV_UNREGISTER handler Currently, the same handler is called for both a NETDEV_BONDING_INFO LAG unlink notification as for a NETDEV_UNREGISTER call. This is causing a problem though, since the netdev_notifier_info passed has a different structure depending on which event is passed. The problem manifests as a call trace from a BUG KASAN stack-out-of-bounds error. Fix this by creating a handler specific to NETDEV_UNREGISTER that only is passed valid elements in the netdev_notifier_info struct for the NETDEV_UNREGISTER event. Also included is the removal of an unbalanced dev_put on the peer_netdev and related braces.",
