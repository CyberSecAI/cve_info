    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net dsa bcm_sf2 dont use devres for mdiobus As explained in commits 74b6d7d13307 (net dsa realtek register the MDIO bus under devres) 5135e96a3dd2 (net dsa dont allocate the slave_mii_bus using devres) mdiobus_free() will panic when called from devm_mdiobus_free() remove on ->shutdown) do not apply. But there is one more which applies here. If the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown (like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device link between the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers() will unbind the bcm_sf2 switch driver on shutdown. So the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, which is either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration, or dont use devres at all. The bcm_sf2 driver has the code structure in place for orderly mdiobus removal, so just replace devm_mdiobus_alloc() with the non-devres variant, and add manual free where necessary, to ensure that we dont let devres free a still-registered bus.",
