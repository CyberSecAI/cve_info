    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved rpmsg char Fix race between the release of rpmsg_ctrldev and cdev struct rpmsg_ctrldev contains a struct cdev. The current code frees the rpmsg_ctrldev struct in rpmsg_ctrldev_release_device(), but the cdev is a managed object, therefore its release is not predictable and the rpmsg_ctrldev could be freed before the cdev is entirely released, as in the backtrace below.
