    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved NFSD Fix ia_size underflow iattria_size is a loff_t, which is a signed 64-bit type. NFSv3 and NFSv4 both define file size as an unsigned 64-bit type. Thus there is a range of valid file size values an NFS client can send that is already larger than Linux can handle. Currently decode_fattr4() dumps a full u64 value into ia_size. If that value happens to be larger than S64_MAX, then ia_size underflows. Im about to fix up the NFSv3 behavior as well, so lets catch the underflow in the common code path nfsd_setattr().",
