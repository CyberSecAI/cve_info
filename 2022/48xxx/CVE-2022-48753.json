  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved block fix memory leak in disk_register_independent_access_ranges kobject_init_and_add() takes reference even when it fails. According to the doc of kobject_init_and_add() If this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to properly clean up the memory associated with the object. Fix this issue by adding kobject_put(). Callback function blk_ia_ranges_sysfs_release() in kobject_put() can handle the pointer iars properly.",
