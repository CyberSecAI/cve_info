    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved eeprom ee1004 limit i2c reads to I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX Commit effa453168a7 (i2c i801 Dont silently correct invalid transfer size) revealed that ee1004_eeprom_read() did not properly limit how many bytes to read at once. In particular, i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data_or_emulated() takes the length to read as an u8. If count == 256 after taking into account the offset and page boundary, the cast to u8 overflows. And this is common when user space tries to read the entire EEPROM at once. To fix it, limit each read to I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX (32) bytes, already the maximum length i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data_or_emulated() allows.",
