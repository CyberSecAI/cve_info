    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sfc fix null pointer dereference in efx_hard_start_xmit Trying to get the channel from the tx_queue variable here is wrong because we can only be here if tx_queue is NULL, so we shouldnt dereference it. As the above comment in the code says, this is very unlikely to happen, but its wrong anyway so lets fix it. I hit this issue because of a different bug that caused tx_queue to be NULL. If that happens, this is the error message that we get here BUG unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020 [...] RIP 0010efx_hard_start_xmit+0x153/0x170 [sfc]",
