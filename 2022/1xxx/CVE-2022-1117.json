    "description": "A vulnerability was found in fapolicyd. The vulnerability occurs due to an assumption on how glibc names the runtime linker, a build time regular expression may not correctly detect the runtime linker. The consequence is that the pattern detection for applications launched by the run time linker may fail to detect the pattern and allow execution.",
