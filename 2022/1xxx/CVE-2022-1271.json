    "description": "An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzips zgrep utility. When zgrep is applied on the attackers chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attackers content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.",
