    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of TP-Link TL-WR841N TL-WR841N(US)_V14_220121 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the ated_tp service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-17356.",
