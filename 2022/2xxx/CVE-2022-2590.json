    "description": "A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernels memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only shared memory mappings. This flaw allows an unprivileged, local user to gain write access to read-only memory mappings, increasing their privileges on the system.",
