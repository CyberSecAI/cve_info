    "description": "An authenticated, remote attacker can gain access to a dereferenced pointer contained in a request. The accesses can subsequently lead to local overwriting of memory in the CmpTraceMgr, whereby the attacker can neither gain the values read internally nor control the values to be written. If invalid memory is accessed, this results in a crash.",
