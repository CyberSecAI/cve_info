    "description": "A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS, Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When a BGP flow route with redirect IP extended community is received, and the reachability to the next-hop of the corresponding redirect IP is flapping, the rpd process might crash. Whether the crash occurs depends on the timing of the internally processing of these two events and is outside the attackers control. Please note that this issue also affects Route-Reflectors unless routing-options flow firewall-install-disable is configured. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S10, 18.4R3-S10 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S7 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S8 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S3 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S2 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to 20.4R2-EVO 21.1-EVO versions prior to 21.1R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.4R1.",
