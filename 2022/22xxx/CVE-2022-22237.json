  "description": "An Improper Authentication vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause an impact on confidentiality or integrity. A vulnerability in the processing of TCP-AO will allow a BGP or LDP peer not configured with authentication to establish a session even if the peer is locally configured to use authentication. This could lead to untrusted or unauthorized sessions being established. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S1 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2-S2, 21.3R3 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-S1, 21.4R3 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R1-S1, 22.1R2.
