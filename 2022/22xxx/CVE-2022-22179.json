    "description": "A Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP daemon (jdhcpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker to cause a crash of jdhcpd and thereby a Denial of Service (DoS). In a scenario where DHCP relay or local server is configured the problem can be triggered if a DHCPv4 packet with specific options is received leading to a corruption of the options read from the packet. This corruption can then lead to jdhcpd crash and restart. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 17.4R1 and later versions prior to 18.4R3-S10 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S7 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S4 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S6 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S2 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S3 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S2 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S1 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R1-S2, 21.2R2, 21.2R3 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R1-S1, 21.3R2.",
