    "description": "Apache Karaf obr* commands and run goal on the karaf-maven-plugin have partial path traversal which allows to break out of expected folder. The risk is low as obr* commands are not very used and the entry is set by user. This has been fixed in revision https//gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf.gith=36a2bc4 https//gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf.gith=52b70cf Mitigation Apache Karaf users should upgrade to 4.2.15 or 4.3.6 or later as soon as possible, or use correct path.
