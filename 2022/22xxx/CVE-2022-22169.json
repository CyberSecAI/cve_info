    "description": "An Improper Initialization vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker who sends specific packets in certain orders and at specific timings to force OSPFv3 to unexpectedly enter graceful-restart (GR helper mode) even though there is not any Grace-LSA received in OSPFv3 causing a Denial of Service (DoS). Unexpectedly entering GR helper mode might cause the OSPFv3 neighbor adjacency formed on this interface to be stuck in the INIT state which can be observed by issuing the following command user@device> show ospf3 neighbor ID Interface State xx.xx.xx.xx ae100.0 Init area xx.xx.xx.xx) state changed from Full to Init due to 1WayRcvd (event reason neighbor is in one-way mode) (nbr helped 0) This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS. 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S11 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S6 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S10 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S7 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S4 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S7, 19.3R3-S4 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S6 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S3 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2, 20.4R3 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R1-S1, 21.2R2.
