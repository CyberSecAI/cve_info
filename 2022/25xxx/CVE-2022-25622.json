    "description": "The PROFINET (PNIO) stack, when integrated with the Interniche IP stack, improperly handles internal resources for TCP segments where the minimum TCP-Header length is less than defined. This could allow an attacker to create a denial of service condition for TCP services on affected devices by sending specially crafted TCP segments.",
