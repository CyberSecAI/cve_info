    "description": "The Linux-PAM package before 1.5.2-6.1 for openSUSE Tumbleweed allows authentication bypass for SSH logins. The pam_access.so module doesnt correctly restrict login if a user tries to connect from an IP address that is not resolvable via DNS. In such conditions, a user with denied access to a machine can still get access. NOTE the relevance of this issue is largely limited to openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Factory it does not affect Linux-PAM upstream.",
