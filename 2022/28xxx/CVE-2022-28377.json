    "description": "On Verizon 5G Home LVSKIHP InDoorUnit (IDU) 3.4.66.162 and OutDoorUnit (ODU) 3.33.101.0 devices, the CRTC and ODU RPC endpoints rely on a static account username/password for access control. This password can be generated via a binary included in the firmware, after ascertaining the MAC address of the IDUs base Ethernet interface, and adding the string DEVICE_MANUFACTURER=Wistron_NeWeb_Corp. to /etc/device_info to replicate the host environment. This occurs in /etc/init.d/wnc_factoryssidkeypwd (IDU).",
