    "description": "Out-of-bounds write when handling split HTTP headers When handling split HTTP headers, GRUB2 HTTP code accidentally moves its internal data buffer point by one position. This can lead to a out-of-bound write further when parsing the HTTP request, writing a NULL byte past the buffer. Its conceivable that an attacker controlled set of packets can lead to corruption of the GRUB2s internal memory metadata.",
