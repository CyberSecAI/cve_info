    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/irdma Prevent some integer underflows My static checker complains that drivers/infiniband/hw/irdma/ctrl.c3605 irdma_sc_ceq_init() warn can subtract underflow info->dev->hmc_fpm_misc.max_ceqs? It appears that info->dev->hmc_fpm_misc.max_ceqs comes from the firmware in irdma_sc_parse_fpm_query_buf() so, yes, there is a chance that it could be zero. Even if we trust the firmware, its easy enough to change the condition just as a hardenning measure.",
