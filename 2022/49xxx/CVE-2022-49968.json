    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ieee802154/adf7242 defer destroy_workqueue call There is a possible race condition (use-after-free) like below (FREE) | (USE) adf7242_remove | adf7242_channel cancel_delayed_work_sync | destroy_workqueue (1) | adf7242_cmd_rx | mod_delayed_work (2) | The root cause for this race is that the upper layer (ieee802154) is unaware of this detaching event and the function adf7242_channel can be called without any checks. To fix this, we can add a flag write at the beginning of adf7242_remove and add flag check in adf7242_channel. Or we can just defer the destructive operation like other commit 3e0588c291d6 (hamradio defer ax25 kfree after unregister_netdev) which let the ieee802154_unregister_hw() to handle the synchronization. This patch takes the second option. runs)",
