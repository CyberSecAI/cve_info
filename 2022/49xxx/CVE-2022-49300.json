    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nbd fix race between nbd_alloc_config() and module removal When nbd module is being removing, nbd_alloc_config() may be called concurrently by nbd_genl_connect(), although try_module_get() will return false, but nbd_alloc_config() doesnt handle it. The race may lead to the leak of nbd_config and its related resources (e.g, recv_workq) and oops in nbd_read_stat() due to the unload of nbd module as shown below",
