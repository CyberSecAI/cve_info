    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media imx-jpeg fix a bug of accessing array out of bounds When error occurs in parsing jpeg, the slot isnt acquired yet, it may be the default value MXC_MAX_SLOTS. If the driver access the slot using the incorrect slot number, it will access array out of bounds. The result is the driver will change num_domains, which follows slot_data in struct mxc_jpeg_dev. Then the driver wont detach the pm domain at rmmod, which will lead to kernel panic when trying to insmod again.",
