    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved extcon Modify extcon device to be created after driver data is set Currently, someone can invoke the sysfs such as state_show() intermittently before dev_set_drvdata() is done. And it can be a cause of kernel Oops because of edev is Null at that time. So modified the driver registration to after setting drviver data. - Oopss backtrace.
