    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved perf/x86/amd fix potential integer overflow on shift of a int The left shift of int 32 bit integer constant 1 is evaluated using 32 bit arithmetic and then passed as a 64 bit function argument. In the case where i is 32 or more this can lead to an overflow. Avoid this by shifting using the BIT_ULL macro instead.",
