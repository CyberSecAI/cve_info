    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi lpfc Fix null pointer dereference after failing to issue FLOGI and PLOGI If lpfc_issue_els_flogi() fails and returns non-zero status, the node reference count is decremented to trigger the release of the nodelist structure. However, if there is a prior registration or dev-loss-evt work pending, the node may be released prematurely. When dev-loss-evt completes, the released node is referenced causing a use-after-free null pointer dereference. Similarly, when processing non-zero ELS PLOGI completion status in lpfc_cmpl_els_plogi(), the ndlp flags are checked for a transport registration before triggering node removal. If dev-loss-evt work is pending, the node may be released prematurely and a subsequent call to lpfc_dev_loss_tmo_handler() results in a use after free ndlp dereference. Add test for pending dev-loss before decrementing the node reference count for FLOGI, PLOGI, PRLI, and ADISC handling.",
