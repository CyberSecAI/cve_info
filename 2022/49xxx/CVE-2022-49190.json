    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved kernel/resource fix kfree() of bootmem memory again Since commit ebff7d8f270d (mem hotunplug fix kfree() of bootmem memory), we could get a resource allocated during boot via alloc_resource(). And its required to release the resource using free_resource(). Howerver, many people use kfree directly which will result in kernel BUG. In order to fix this without fixing every call site, just leak a couple of bytes in such corner case.",
