    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved can af_can fix NULL pointer dereference in can_rx_register() It causes NULL pointer dereference when testing as following (a) use syscall(__NR_socket, 0x10ul, 3ul, 0) to create netlink socket. (b) use syscall(__NR_sendmsg, ...) to create bond link device and vxcan link device, and bind vxcan device to bond device (can also use ifenslave command to bind vxcan device to bond device). (c) use syscall(__NR_socket, 0x1dul, 3ul, 1) to create CAN socket. (d) use syscall(__NR_bind, ...) to bind the bond device to CAN socket. The bond device invokes the can-raw protocol registration interface to receive CAN packets. However, ml_priv is not allocated to the dev, dev_rcv_lists is assigned to NULL in can_rx_register(). In this case, it will occur the NULL pointer dereference issue. The following is the stack information",
