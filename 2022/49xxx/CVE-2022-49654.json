    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net dsa qca8k reset cpu port on MTU change It was discovered that the Documentation lacks of a fundamental detail on how to correctly change the MAX_FRAME_SIZE of the switch. In fact if the MAX_FRAME_SIZE is changed while the cpu port is on, the switch panics and cease to send any packet. This cause the mgmt ethernet system to not receive any packet (the slow fallback still works) and makes the device not reachable. To recover from this a switch reset is required. To correctly handle this, turn off the cpu ports before changing the MAX_FRAME_SIZE and turn on again after the value is applied.",
