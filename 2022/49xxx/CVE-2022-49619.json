    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net sfp fix memory leak in sfp_probe() sfp_probe() allocates a memory chunk from sfp with sfp_alloc(). When devm_add_action() fails, sfp is not freed, which leads to a memory leak. We should use devm_add_action_or_reset() instead of devm_add_action().",
