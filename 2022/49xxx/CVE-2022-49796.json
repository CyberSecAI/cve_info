    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tracing kprobe Fix potential null-ptr-deref on trace_array in kprobe_event_gen_test_exit() When test_gen_kprobe_cmd() failed after kprobe_event_gen_cmd_end(), it will goto delete, which will call kprobe_event_delete() and release the corresponding resource. However, the trace_array in gen_kretprobe_test will point to the invalid resource. Set gen_kretprobe_test to NULL after called kprobe_event_delete() to prevent null-ptr-deref.",
