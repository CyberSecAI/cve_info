    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iommu/vt-d Fix PCI device refcount leak in dmar_dev_scope_init() for_each_pci_dev() is implemented by pci_get_device(). The comment of pci_get_device() says that it will increase the reference count for the returned pci_dev and also decrease the reference count for the input pci_dev @from if it is not NULL. If we break for_each_pci_dev() loop with pdev not NULL, we need to call pci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count. Add the missing pci_dev_put() for the error path to avoid reference count leak.",
