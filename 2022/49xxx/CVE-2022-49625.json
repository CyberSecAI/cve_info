  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sfc fix kernel panic when creating VF When creating VFs a kernel panic can happen when calling to efx_ef10_try_update_nic_stats_vf. When releasing a DMA coherent buffer, sometimes, I dont know in what specific circumstances, it has to unmap memory with vunmap. It is disallowed to do that in IRQ context or with BH disabled. Otherwise, we hit this line in vunmap, causing the crash BUG_ON(in_interrupt()) This patch reenables BH to release the buffer. Log messages when the bug is hit kernel BUG at mm/vmalloc.c2727! invalid opcode 0000",
