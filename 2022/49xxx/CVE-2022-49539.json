    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved rtw89 ser fix CAM leaks occurring in L2 reset The CAM, meaning address CAM and bssid CAM here, will get leaks during SER (system error recover) L2 reset process and ieee80211_restart_hw() which is called by L2 reset process eventually. The normal flow would be like -> add interface (acquire 1) -> enter ips (release 1) -> leave ips (acquire 1) -> connection (occupy 1) The ieee80211_restart_hw() flow (under connection) -> ieee80211 reconfig -> add interface (acquire 1) -> leave ips (acquire 1) -> connection (occupy (A) + 2) Originally, CAM is released before HW restart only if connection is under security. Now, release CAM whatever connection it is to fix leak in (A). OTOH, check if CAM is already valid to avoid acquiring multiple times to fix (B). Besides, if AP mode, release address CAM of all stations before HW restart.",
