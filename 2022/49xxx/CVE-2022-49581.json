    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved be2net Fix buffer overflow in be_get_module_eeprom be_cmd_read_port_transceiver_data assumes that it is given a buffer that is at least PAGE_DATA_LEN long, or twice that if the module supports SFF 8472. However, this is not always the case. Fix this by passing the desired offset and length to be_cmd_read_port_transceiver_data so that we only copy the bytes once.",
