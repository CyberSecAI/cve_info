    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net stmmac dwc-qos Disable split header for Tegra194 There is a long-standing issue with the Synopsys DWC Ethernet driver for Tegra194 where random system crashes have been observed [0]. The problem occurs when the split header feature is enabled in the stmmac driver. In the bad case, a larger than expected buffer length is received and causes the calculation of the total buffer length to overflow. This results in a very large buffer length that causes the kernel to crash. Why this larger buffer length is received is not clear, however, the feedback from the NVIDIA design team is that the split header feature is not supported for Tegra194. Therefore, disable split header support for Tegra194 to prevent these random crashes from occurring. [0] https//lore.kernel.org/linux-tegra/b0b17697-f23e-8fa5-3757-604a86f3a095@nvidia.com/",
