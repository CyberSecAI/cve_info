    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Dont redirect packets with invalid pkt_len Syzbot found an issue [1] fq_codel_drop() try to drop a flow whitout any skbs, that is, the flow->head is null. The root cause, as the [2] says, is because that bpf_prog_test_run_skb() run a bpf prog which redirects empty skbs. So we should determine whether the length of the packet modified by bpf prog or others like bpf_prog_test is valid before forwarding it directly.",
