    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/mediatek Add vblank register/unregister callback functions We encountered a kernel panic issue that callback data will be NULL when its using in ovl irq handler. There is a timing issue between mtk_disp_ovl_irq_handler() and mtk_ovl_disable_vblank(). To resolve this issue, we use the flow to register/unregister vblank cb - Register callback function and callback data when crtc creates. - Unregister callback function and callback data when crtc destroies. With this solution, we can assure callback data will not be NULL when vblank is disable.",
