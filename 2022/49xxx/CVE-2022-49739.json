    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved gfs2 Always check inode size of inline inodes Check if the inode size of stuffed (inline) inodes is within the allowed range when reading inodes from disk (gfs2_dinode_in()). This prevents us from on-disk corruption. The two checks in stuffed_readpage() and gfs2_unstuffer_page() that just truncate inline data to the maximum allowed size dont actually make sense, and they can be removed now as well.",
