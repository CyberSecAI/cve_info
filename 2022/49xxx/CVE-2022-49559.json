    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM x86 Drop WARNs that assert a triple fault never escapes from L2 Remove WARNs that sanity check that KVM never lets a triple fault for L2 escape and incorrectly end up in L1. In normal operation, the sanity check is perfectly valid, but it incorrectly assumes that its impossible for userspace to induce KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT without bouncing through KVM_RUN (which guarantees kvm_check_nested_state() will see and handle the triple fault). The WARN can currently be triggered if userspace injects a machine check while L2 is active and CR4.MCE=0. And a future fix to allow save/restore of KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT, e.g. so that a synthesized triple fault isnt lost on migration, will make it trivially easy for userspace to trigger the WARN. Clearing KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT when forcibly leaving guest mode is tempting, but wrong, especially if/when the request is saved/restored, e.g. if userspace restores events (including a triple fault) and then restores nested state (which may forcibly leave guest mode). Ignoring the fact that KVM doesnt currently provide the necessary APIs, its userspaces responsibility to manage pending events during save/restore. ------------[ cut here ]------------ WARNING CPU 7 PID 1399 at arch/x86/kvm/vmx/nested.c4522 nested_vmx_vmexit+0x7fe/0xd90 [kvm_intel] Modules linked in kvm_intel kvm irqbypass CPU 7 PID 1399 Comm state_test Not tainted 5.17.0-rc3+ #808 Hardware name QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015 RIP 0010nested_vmx_vmexit+0x7fe/0xd90 [kvm_intel] Call Trace vmx_leave_nested+0x30/0x40 [kvm_intel] vmx_set_nested_state+0xca/0x3e0 [kvm_intel] kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl+0xf49/0x13e0 [kvm] kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x4b9/0x660 [kvm] __x64_sys_ioctl+0x83/0xb0 do_syscall_64+0x3b/0xc0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---",
