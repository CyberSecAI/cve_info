    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net remove two BUG() from skb_checksum_help() I have a syzbot report that managed to get a crash in skb_checksum_help() If syzbot can trigger these BUG(), it makes sense to replace them with more friendly WARN_ON_ONCE() since skb_checksum_help() can instead return an error code. Note that syzbot will still crash there, until real bug is fixed.",
