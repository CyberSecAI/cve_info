    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vt Clear selection before changing the font When changing the console font with ioctl(KDFONTOP) the new font size can be bigger than the previous font. A previous selection may thus now be outside of the new screen size and thus trigger out-of-bounds accesses to graphics memory if the selection is removed in vc_do_resize(). Prevent such out-of-memory accesses by dropping the selection before the various con_font_set() console handlers are called.",
