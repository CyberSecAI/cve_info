    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi lpfc Resolve NULL ptr dereference after an ELS LOGO is aborted A use-after-free crash can occur after an ELS LOGO is aborted. Specifically, a nodelist structure is freed and then ndlp->vport->cfg_log_verbose is dereferenced in lpfc_nlp_get() when the discovery state machine is mistakenly called a second time with NLP_EVT_DEVICE_RM argument. Rework lpfc_cmpl_els_logo() to prevent the duplicate calls to release a nodelist structure.",
