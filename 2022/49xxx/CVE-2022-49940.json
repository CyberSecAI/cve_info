    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tty n_gsm add sanity check for gsm->receive in gsm_receive_buf() A null pointer dereference can happen when attempting to access the gsm->receive() function in gsmld_receive_buf(). Currently, the code assumes that gsm->recieve is only called after MUX activation. Since the gsmld_receive_buf() function can be accessed without the need to initialize the MUX, the gsm->receive() function will not be set and a NULL pointer dereference will occur. Fix this by avoiding the call to gsm->receive() in case the function is not initialized by adding a sanity check.
