    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved erofs fix missing xas_retry() in fscache mode The xarray iteration only holds the RCU read lock and thus may encounter XA_RETRY_ENTRY if theres process modifying the xarray concurrently. This will cause oops when referring to the invalid entry. Fix this by adding the missing xas_retry(), which will make the iteration wind back to the root node if XA_RETRY_ENTRY is encountered.",
