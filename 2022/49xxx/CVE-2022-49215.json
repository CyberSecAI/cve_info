    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved xsk Fix race at socket teardown Fix a race in the xsk socket teardown code that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference splat. The current xsk unbind code in xsk_unbind_dev() starts by setting xs->state to XSK_UNBOUND, sets xs->dev to NULL and then waits for any NAPI processing to terminate using synchronize_net(). After that, the release code starts to tear down the socket state and free allocated memory.",
