    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs do not clean up repair bio if submit fails The submit helper will always run bio_endio() on the bio if it fails to submit, so cleaning up the bio just leads to a variety of use-after-free and NULL pointer dereference bugs because we race with the endio function that is cleaning up the bio. Instead just return BLK_STS_OK as the repair function has to continue to process the rest of the pages, and the endio for the repair bio will do the appropriate cleanup for the page that it was given.",
