    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC atmel Fix error handling in snd_proto_probe The device_node pointer is returned by of_parse_phandle() with refcount incremented. We should use of_node_put() on it when done. This function only calls of_node_put() in the regular path. And it will cause refcount leak in error paths. Fix this by calling of_node_put() in error handling too.",
