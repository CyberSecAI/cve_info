  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM x86 smm number of GPRs in the SMRAM image depends on the image format On 64 bit host, if the guest doesnt have X86_FEATURE_LM, KVM will access 16 gprs to 32-bit smram image, causing out-ouf-bound ram access. On 32 bit host, the rsm_load_state_64/enter_smm_save_state_64 is compiled out, thus access overflow cant happen.",
