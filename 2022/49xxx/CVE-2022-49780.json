    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi target tcm_loop Fix possible name leak in tcm_loop_setup_hba_bus() If device_register() fails in tcm_loop_setup_hba_bus(), the name allocated by dev_set_name() need be freed. As comment of device_register() says, it should use put_device() to give up the reference in the error path. So fix this by calling put_device(), then the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup(). The tl_hba will be freed in tcm_loop_release_adapter(), so it dont need goto error label in this case.",
