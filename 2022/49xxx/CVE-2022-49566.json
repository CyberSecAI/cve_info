    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved crypto qat - fix memory leak in RSA When an RSA key represented in form 2 (as defined in PKCS #1 V2.1) is used, some components of the private key persist even after the TFM is released. Replace the explicit calls to free the buffers in qat_rsa_exit_tfm() with a call to qat_rsa_clear_ctx() which frees all buffers referenced in the TFM context.",
