    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi mac80211 Fix UAF in ieee80211_scan_rx() ieee80211_scan_rx() tries to access scan_req->flags after a null check, but a UAF is observed when the scan is completed and __ieee80211_scan_completed() executes, which then calls cfg80211_scan_done() leading to the freeing of scan_req. Since scan_req is rcu_dereference()d, prevent the racing in __ieee80211_scan_completed() by ensuring that from mac80211s POV it is no longer accessed from an RCU read critical section before we call cfg80211_scan_done().",
