    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drivers staging rtl8192u Fix deadlock in ieee80211_beacons_stop() There is a deadlock in ieee80211_beacons_stop(), which is shown below (Thread 1) | (Thread 2) | ieee80211_send_beacon() ieee80211_beacons_stop() | mod_timer() spin_lock_irqsave() //(1) | (wait a time) ... | ieee80211_send_beacon_cb() del_timer_sync() | spin_lock_irqsave() //(2) (wait timer to stop) | ... We hold ieee->beacon_lock in position (1) of thread 1 and use del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler also need ieee->beacon_lock in position (2) of thread 2. As a result, ieee80211_beacons_stop() will block forever. This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of spin_lock_irqsave(), which could let timer handler to obtain the needed lock.",
