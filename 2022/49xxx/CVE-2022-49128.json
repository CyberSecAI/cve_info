    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/bridge Add missing pm_runtime_put_sync pm_runtime_get_sync() will increase the rumtime PM counter even when it returns an error. Thus a pairing decrement is needed to prevent refcount leak. Fix this by replacing this API with pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), which will not change the runtime PM counter on error. Besides, a matching decrement is needed on the error handling path to keep the counter balanced.",
