    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ata libata-core fix NULL pointer deref in ata_host_alloc_pinfo() In an unlikely (and probably wrong?) case that the ppi parameter of ata_host_alloc_pinfo() points to an array starting with a NULL pointer, theres going to be a kernel oops as the pi local variable wont get reassigned from the initial value of NULL. Initialize pi instead to &ata_dummy_port_info to fix the possible kernel oops for good... Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static analysis tool.",
