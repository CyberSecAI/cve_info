    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi sd Fix potential NULL pointer dereference If sd_probe() sees an early error before sdkp->device is initialized, sd_zbc_release_disk() is called. This causes a NULL pointer dereference when sd_is_zoned() is called inside that function. Avoid this by removing the call to sd_zbc_release_disk() in sd_probe() error path. This change is safe and does not result in zone information memory leakage because the zone information for a zoned disk is allocated only when sd_revalidate_disk() is called, at which point sdkp->disk_dev is fully set, resulting in sd_disk_release() being called when needed to cleanup a disk zone information using sd_zbc_release_disk().",
