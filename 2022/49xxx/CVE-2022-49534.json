    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi lpfc Protect memory leak for NPIV ports sending PLOGI_RJT There is a potential memory leak in lpfc_ignore_els_cmpl() and lpfc_els_rsp_reject() that was allocated from NPIV PLOGI_RJT (lpfc_rcv_plogi()s login_mbox). Check if cmdiocb->context_un.mbox was allocated in lpfc_ignore_els_cmpl(), and then free it back to phba->mbox_mem_pool along with mbox->ctx_buf for service parameters. For lpfc_els_rsp_reject() failure, free both the ctx_buf for service parameters and the login_mbox.",
