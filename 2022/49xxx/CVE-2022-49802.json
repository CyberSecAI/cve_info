    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ftrace Fix null pointer dereference in ftrace_add_mod() The @ftrace_mod is allocated by kzalloc(), so both the members {prev,next} of @ftrace_mode->list are NULL, its not a valid state to call list_del(). If kstrdup() for @ftrace_mod->{func|module} fails, it goes to @out_free tag and calls free_ftrace_mod() to destroy @ftrace_mod, then list_del() will write prev->next and next->prev, where null pointer dereference happens.",
