    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sysctl Fix data races in proc_douintvec(). A sysctl variable is accessed concurrently, and there is always a chance of data-race. So, all readers and writers need some basic protection to avoid load/store-tearing. This patch changes proc_douintvec() to use READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() internally to fix data-races on the sysctl side. For now, proc_douintvec() itself is tolerant to a data-race, but we still need to add annotations on the other subsystems side.",
