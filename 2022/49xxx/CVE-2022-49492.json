    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nvme-pci fix a NULL pointer dereference in nvme_alloc_admin_tags In nvme_alloc_admin_tags, the admin_q can be set to an error (typically -ENOMEM) if the blk_mq_init_queue call fails to set up the queue, which is checked immediately after the call. However, when we return the error message up the stack, to nvme_reset_work the error takes us to nvme_remove_dead_ctrl() nvme_dev_disable() nvme_suspend_queue(&dev->queues[0]). Here, we only check that the admin_q is non-NULL, rather than not an error or NULL, and begin quiescing a queue that never existed, leading to bad / NULL pointer dereference.",
