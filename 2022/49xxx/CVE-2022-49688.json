    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved afs Fix dynamic root getattr The recent patch to make afs_getattr consult the server didnt account for the pseudo-inodes employed by the dynamic root-type afs superblock not having a volume or a server to access, and thus an oops occurs if such a directory is statd. Fix this by checking to see if the vnode->volume pointer actually points anywhere before following it in afs_getattr(). This can be tested by stating a directory in /afs. It may be sufficient just to do ls /afs and the oops looks something like",
