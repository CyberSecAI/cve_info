    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sfc fix use after free when disabling sriov Use after free is detected by kfence when disabling sriov. What was read after being freed was vf->pci_dev it was freed from pci_disable_sriov and later read in efx_ef10_sriov_free_vf_vports, called from efx_ef10_sriov_free_vf_vswitching. Set the pointer to NULL at release time to not trying to read it later. Reproducer and dmesg log (note that kfence doesnt detect it every time) $ echo 1 > /sys/class/net/enp65s0f0np0/device/sriov_numvfs $ echo 0 > /sys/class/net/enp65s0f0np0/device/sriov_numvfs BUG KFENCE use-after-free read in efx_ef10_sriov_free_vf_vswitching+0x82/0x170 [sfc] Use-after-free read at 0x00000000ff3c1ba5 (in kfence-#224) efx_ef10_sriov_free_vf_vswitching+0x82/0x170 [sfc] efx_ef10_pci_sriov_disable+0x38/0x70 [sfc] efx_pci_sriov_configure+0x24/0x40 [sfc] sriov_numvfs_store+0xfe/0x140 kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x11c/0x1b0 new_sync_write+0x11f/0x1b0 vfs_write+0x1eb/0x280 ksys_write+0x5f/0xe0 do_syscall_64+0x5c/0x80 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae kfence-#224 0x00000000edb8ef95-0x00000000671f5ce1, size=2792, cache=kmalloc-4k allocated by task 6771 on cpu 10 at 3137.860196s pci_alloc_dev+0x21/0x60 pci_iov_add_virtfn+0x2a2/0x320 sriov_enable+0x212/0x3e0 efx_ef10_sriov_configure+0x67/0x80 [sfc] efx_pci_sriov_configure+0x24/0x40 [sfc] sriov_numvfs_store+0xba/0x140 kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x11c/0x1b0 new_sync_write+0x11f/0x1b0 vfs_write+0x1eb/0x280 ksys_write+0x5f/0xe0 do_syscall_64+0x5c/0x80 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae freed by task 6771 on cpu 12 at 3170.991309s device_release+0x34/0x90 kobject_cleanup+0x3a/0x130 pci_iov_remove_virtfn+0xd9/0x120 sriov_disable+0x30/0xe0 efx_ef10_pci_sriov_disable+0x57/0x70 [sfc] efx_pci_sriov_configure+0x24/0x40 [sfc] sriov_numvfs_store+0xfe/0x140 kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x11c/0x1b0 new_sync_write+0x11f/0x1b0 vfs_write+0x1eb/0x280 ksys_write+0x5f/0xe0 do_syscall_64+0x5c/0x80 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae",
