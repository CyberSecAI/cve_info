    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi mac80211 fix queue selection for mesh/OCB interfaces When using iTXQ, the code assumes that there is only one vif queue for broadcast packets, using the BE queue. Allowing non-BE queue marking violates that assumption and txq->ac == skb_queue_mapping is no longer guaranteed. This can cause issues with queue handling in the driver and also causes issues with the recent ATF change, resulting in an AQL underflow warning.",
