    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi mac80211 fix general-protection-fault in ieee80211_subif_start_xmit() When device is running and the interface status is changed, the gpf issue is triggered. The problem triggering process is as follows Thread A Thread B ieee80211_runtime_change_iftype() process_one_work() ... ... ieee80211_do_stop() ... ... ... sdata->bss = NULL ... ... ieee80211_subif_start_xmit() ieee80211_multicast_to_unicast //!sdata->bss->multicast_to_unicast cause gpf issue When the interface status is changed, the sending queue continues to send packets. After the bss is set to NULL, the bss is accessed. As a result, this causes a general-protection-fault issue. The following is the stack information general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc000000002f 0000",
