    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tpm use try_get_ops() in tpm-space.c As part of the series conversion to remove nested TPM operations https//lore.kernel.org/all/20190205224723.19671-1-jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com/ exposure of the chip->tpm_mutex was removed from much of the upper level code. In this conversion, tpm2_del_space() was missed. This didnt matter much because its usually called closely after a converted operation, so theres only a very tiny race window where the chip can be removed before the space flushing is done which causes a NULL deref on the mutex. However, there are reports of this window being hit in practice, so fix this by converting tpm2_del_space() to use tpm_try_get_ops(), which performs all the teardown checks before acquring the mutex.",
