    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amdkfd Check for potential null return of kmalloc_array() As the kmalloc_array() may return null, the event_waiters[i].wait would lead to null-pointer dereference. Therefore, it is better to check the return value of kmalloc_array() to avoid this confusion.",
