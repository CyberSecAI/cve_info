  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ath11k mhi use mhi_sync_power_up() If amss.bin was missing ath11k would crash during rmmod ath11k_pci. The reason for that was that we were using mhi_async_power_up() which does not check any errors. But mhi_sync_power_up() on the other hand does check for errors so lets use that to fix the crash. I was not able to find a reason why an async version was used. ath11k_mhi_start() (which enables state ATH11K_MHI_POWER_ON) is called from ath11k_hif_power_up(), which can sleep. So sync version should be safe to use here. [ 145.569731] general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000 0000",
