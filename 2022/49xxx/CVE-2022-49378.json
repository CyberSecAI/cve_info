    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sfc fix considering that all channels have TX queues Normally, all channels have RX and TX queues, but this is not true if modparam efx_separate_tx_channels=1 is used. In that cases, some channels only have RX queues and others only TX queues (or more preciselly, they have them allocated, but not initialized). Fix efx_channel_has_tx_queues to return the correct value for this case too.
