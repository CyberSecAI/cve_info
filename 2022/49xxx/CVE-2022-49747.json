    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved erofs/zmap.c Fix incorrect offset calculation Effective offset to add to length was being incorrectly calculated, which resulted in iomap->length being set to 0, triggering a WARN_ON in iomap_iter_done(). Fix that, and describe it in comments. This was reported as a crash by syzbot under an issue about a warning encountered in iomap_iter_done(), but unrelated to erofs.
