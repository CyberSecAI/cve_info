    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved NFSv4.2 fix reference count leaks in _nfs42_proc_copy_notify() [You dont often get email from xiongx18@fudan.edu.cn. Learn why this is important at http//aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification.] The reference counting issue happens in two error paths in the function _nfs42_proc_copy_notify(). In both error paths, the function simply returns the error code and forgets to balance the refcount of object `ctx`, bumped by get_nfs_open_context() earlier, which may cause refcount leaks. Fix it by balancing refcount of the `ctx` object before the function returns in both error paths.",
