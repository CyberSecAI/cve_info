    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tcp add accessors to read/set tp->snd_cwnd We had various bugs over the years with code breaking the assumption that tp->snd_cwnd is greater than zero. Lately, syzbot reported the WARN_ON_ONCE(!tp->prior_cwnd) added in commit 8b8a321ff72c (tcp fix zero cwnd in tcp_cwnd_reduction) can trigger, and without a repro we would have to spend considerable time finding the bug. Instead of complaining too late, we want to catch where and when tp->snd_cwnd is set to an illegal value.",
