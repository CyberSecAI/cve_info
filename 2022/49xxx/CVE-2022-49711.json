    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bus fsl-mc-bus fix KASAN use-after-free in fsl_mc_bus_remove() In fsl_mc_bus_remove(), mc->root_mc_bus_dev->mc_io is passed to fsl_destroy_mc_io(). However, mc->root_mc_bus_dev is already freed in fsl_mc_device_remove(). Then reference to mc->root_mc_bus_dev->mc_io triggers KASAN use-after-free. To avoid the use-after-free, keep the reference to mc->root_mc_bus_dev->mc_io in a local variable and pass to fsl_destroy_mc_io(). This patch needs rework to apply to kernels older than v5.15.",
