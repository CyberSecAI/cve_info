    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 avoid cycles in directory h-tree A maliciously corrupted filesystem can contain cycles in the h-tree stored inside a directory. That can easily lead to the kernel corrupting tree nodes that were already verified under its hands while doing a node split and consequently accessing unallocated memory. Fix the problem by verifying traversed block numbers are unique.",
