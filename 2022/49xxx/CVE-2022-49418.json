    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved NFSv4 Fix free of uninitialized nfs4_label on referral lookup. Send along the already-allocated fattr along with nfs4_fs_locations, and drop the memcpy of fattr. We end up growing two more allocations, but this fixes up a crash as PID 790 TASK ffff88811b43c000 CPU 0 COMMAND ls #0 [ffffc90000857920] panic at ffffffff81b9bfde #1 [ffffc900008579c0] do_trap at ffffffff81023a9b #2 [ffffc90000857a10] do_error_trap at ffffffff81023b78 #3 [ffffc90000857a58] exc_stack_segment at ffffffff81be1f45 #4 [ffffc90000857a80] asm_exc_stack_segment at ffffffff81c009de #5 [ffffc90000857b08] nfs_lookup at ffffffffa0302322 [nfs] #6 [ffffc90000857b70] __lookup_slow at ffffffff813a4a5f #7 [ffffc90000857c60] walk_component at ffffffff813a86c4 #8 [ffffc90000857cb8] path_lookupat at ffffffff813a9553 #9 [ffffc90000857cf0] filename_lookup at ffffffff813ab86b",
