    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Fix a data-race around bpf_jit_limit. While reading bpf_jit_limit, it can be changed concurrently via sysctl, WRITE_ONCE() in __do_proc_doulongvec_minmax(). The size of bpf_jit_limit is long, so we need to add a paired READ_ONCE() to avoid load-tearing.",
