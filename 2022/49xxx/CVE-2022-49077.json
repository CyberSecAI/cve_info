    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mmmremap.c avoid pointless invalidate_range_start/end on mremap(old_size=0) If an mremap() syscall with old_size=0 ends up in move_page_tables(), it will call invalidate_range_start()/invalidate_range_end() unnecessarily, i.e. with an empty range. This causes a WARN in KVMs mmu_notifier. In the past, empty ranges have been diagnosed to be off-by-one bugs, hence the WARNing. Given the low (so far) number of unique reports, the benefits of detecting more buggy callers seem to outweigh the cost of having to fix cases such as this one, where userspace is doing something silly. In this particular case, an early return from move_page_tables() is enough to fix the issue.",
