    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpftool Fix NULL pointer dereference when pin {PROG, MAP, LINK} without FILE When using bpftool to pin {PROG, MAP, LINK} without FILE, segmentation fault will occur. The reson is that the lack of FILE will cause strlen to trigger NULL pointer dereference. The corresponding stacktrace is shown below do_pin do_pin_any do_pin_fd mount_bpffs_for_pin strlen(name) <- NULL pointer dereference Fix it by adding validation to the common process.",
