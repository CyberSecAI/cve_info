    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/panfrost Job should reference MMU not file_priv For a while now its been allowed for a MMU context to outlive its corresponding panfrost_priv, however the job structure still references panfrost_priv to get hold of the MMU context. If panfrost_priv has been freed this is a use-after-free which Ive been able to trigger resulting in a splat. To fix this, drop the reference to panfrost_priv in the job structure and add a direct reference to the MMU structure which is whats actually needed.",
