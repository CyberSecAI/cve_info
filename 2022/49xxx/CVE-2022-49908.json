Yet the problem is that, HCI core may not free the skb after handling ACL data packets. To be more specific, when start fragment does not contain the L2CAP length, HCI core just copies skb into conn->rx_skb and finishes frame process in l2cap_recv_acldata(), without freeing the skb, which triggers the above memory leak. This patch solves it by releasing the relative skb, after processing the above case in l2cap_recv_acldata().",
