    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved md Dont set mddev private to NULL in raid0 pers->free In normal stop process, it does like this do_md_stop | __md_stop (pers->free() mddev->private=NULL) | md_free (free mddev) __md_stop sets mddev->private to NULL after pers->free. The raid device will be stopped and mddev memory is free. But in reshape, it doesnt free the mddev and mddev will still be used in new raid. In reshape, it first sets mddev->private to new_pers and then runs old_pers->free(). Now raid0 sets mddev->private to NULL in raid0_free. The new raid cant work anymore. It will panic when dereference mddev->private because of NULL pointer dereference. It can panic like this",
