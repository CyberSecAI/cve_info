    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi mac80211 Dont finalize CSA in IBSS mode if state is disconnected When we are not connected to a channel, sending channel switch announcement doesnt make any sense. The BSS list is empty in that case. This causes the for loop in cfg80211_get_bss() to be bypassed, so the function returns NULL (check line 1424 of net/wireless/scan.c), causing the WARN_ON() in ieee80211_ibss_csa_beacon() to get triggered (check line 500 of net/mac80211/ibss.c), which was consequently reported on the syzkaller dashboard. Thus, check if we have an existing connection before generating the CSA beacon in ieee80211_ibss_finish_csa().",
