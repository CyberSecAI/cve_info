    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved fs/ntfs3 validate BOOT sectors_per_clusters When the NTFS BOOT sectors_per_clusters field is > 0x80, it represents a shift value. Make sure that the shift value is not too large before using it (NTFS max cluster size is 2MB). Return -EVINVAL if it too large. This prevents negative shift values and shift values that are larger than the field size. Prevents this UBSAN error UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds in ../fs/ntfs3/super.c67316 shift exponent -192 is negative",
