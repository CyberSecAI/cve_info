    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/9p Fix a potential socket leak in p9_socket_open Both p9_fd_create_tcp() and p9_fd_create_unix() will call p9_socket_open(). If the creation of p9_trans_fd fails, p9_fd_create_tcp() and p9_fd_create_unix() will return an error directly instead of releasing the cscoket, which will result in a socket leak. This patch adds sock_release() to fix the leak issue.",
