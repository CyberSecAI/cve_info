    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Fix a NULL pointer dereference in amdgpu_dm_connector_add_common_modes() In amdgpu_dm_connector_add_common_modes(), amdgpu_dm_create_common_mode() is assigned to mode and is passed to drm_mode_probed_add() directly after that. drm_mode_probed_add() passes &mode->head to list_add_tail(), and there is a dereference of it in list_add_tail() without recoveries, which could lead to NULL pointer dereference on failure of amdgpu_dm_create_common_mode(). Fix this by adding a NULL check of mode. This bug was found by a static analyzer. Builds with make allyesconfig show no new warnings, and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.",
