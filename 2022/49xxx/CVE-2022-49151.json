    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved can mcba_usb properly check endpoint type Syzbot reported warning in usb_submit_urb() which is caused by wrong endpoint type. We should check that in endpoint is actually present to prevent this warning. Found pipes are now saved to struct mcba_priv and code uses them directly instead of making pipes in place.
