    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved arm64 cacheinfo Fix incorrect assignment of signed error value to unsigned fw_level Though acpi_find_last_cache_level() always returned signed value and the document states it will return any errors caused by lack of a PPTT table, it never returned negative values before. Commit 0c80f9e165f8 (ACPI PPTT Leave the table mapped for the runtime usage) however changed it by returning -ENOENT if no PPTT was found. The value returned from acpi_find_last_cache_level() is then assigned to unsigned fw_level. It will result in the number of cache leaves calculated incorrectly as a huge value which will then cause the following warning from __alloc_pages as the order would be great than MAX_ORDER because of incorrect and huge cache leaves value. | WARNING CPU 0 PID 1 at mm/page_alloc.c5407 __alloc_pages+0x74/0x314 | Modules linked in | CPU 0 PID 1 Comm swapper/0 Not tainted 5.19.0-10393-g7c2a8d3ac4c0 #73 | pstate 20000005 (nzCv daif -PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--) | pc __alloc_pages+0x74/0x314 | lr alloc_pages+0xe8/0x318 | Call trace | __alloc_pages+0x74/0x314 | alloc_pages+0xe8/0x318 | kmalloc_order_trace+0x68/0x1dc | __kmalloc+0x240/0x338 | detect_cache_attributes+0xe0/0x56c | update_siblings_masks+0x38/0x284 | store_cpu_topology+0x78/0x84 | smp_prepare_cpus+0x48/0x134 | kernel_init_freeable+0xc4/0x14c | kernel_init+0x2c/0x1b4 | ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20 Fix the same by changing fw_level to be signed integer and return the error from init_cache_level() early in case of error.",
