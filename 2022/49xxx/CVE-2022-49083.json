    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iommu/omap Fix regression in probe for NULL pointer dereference Commit 3f6634d997db (iommu Use right way to retrieve iommu_ops) started triggering a NULL pointer dereference for some omap variants __iommu_probe_device from probe_iommu_group+0x2c/0x38 probe_iommu_group from bus_for_each_dev+0x74/0xbc bus_for_each_dev from bus_iommu_probe+0x34/0x2e8 bus_iommu_probe from bus_set_iommu+0x80/0xc8 bus_set_iommu from omap_iommu_init+0x88/0xcc omap_iommu_init from do_one_initcall+0x44/0x24 This is caused by omap iommu probe returning 0 instead of ERR_PTR(-ENODEV) as noted by Jason Gunthorpe . Looks like the regression already happened with an earlier commit 6785eb9105e3 (iommu/omap Convert to probe/release_device() call-backs) that changed the function return type and missed converting one place.",
