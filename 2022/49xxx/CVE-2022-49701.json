  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi ibmvfc Allocate/free queue resource only during probe/remove Currently, the sub-queues and event pool resources are allocated/freed for every CRQ connection event such as reset and LPM. This exposes the driver to a couple issues. First the inefficiency of freeing and reallocating memory that can simply be resued after being sanitized. Further, a system under memory pressue runs the risk of allocation failures that could result in a crippled driver. Finally, there is a race window where command submission/compeletion can try to pull/return elements from/to an event pool that is being deleted or already has been deleted due to the lack of host state around freeing/allocating resources. The following is an example of list corruption following a live partition migration (LPM) Oops Exception in kernel mode, sig 5",
