    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bfq Update cgroup information before merging bio When the process is migrated to a different cgroup (or in case of writeback just starts submitting bios associated with a different cgroup) bfq_merge_bio() can operate with stale cgroup information in bic. Thus the bio can be merged to a request from a different cgroup or it can result in merging of bfqqs for different cgroups or bfqqs of already dead cgroups and causing possible use-after-free issues. Fix the problem by updating cgroup information in bfq_merge_bio().",
