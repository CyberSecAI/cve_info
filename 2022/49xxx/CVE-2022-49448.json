    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved soc bcm Check for NULL return of devm_kzalloc() As the potential failure of allocation, devm_kzalloc() may return NULL. Then the pd->pmb and the follow lines of code may bring null pointer dereference. Therefore, it is better to check the return value of devm_kzalloc() to avoid this confusion.",
