    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i2c designware use casting of u64 in clock multiplication to avoid overflow In functions i2c_dw_scl_lcnt() and i2c_dw_scl_hcnt() may have overflow by depending on the values of the given parameters including the ic_clk. For example in our use case where ic_clk is larger than one million, multiplication of ic_clk * 4700 will result in 32 bit overflow. Add cast of u64 to the calculation to avoid multiplication overflow, and use the corresponding define for divide.",
