    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mmc sdhci-pci Fix possible memory leak caused by missing pci_dev_put() pci_get_device() will increase the reference count for the returned pci_dev. We need to use pci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count before amd_probe() returns. There is no problem for the smbus_dev == NULL branch because pci_dev_put() can also handle the NULL input parameter case.",
