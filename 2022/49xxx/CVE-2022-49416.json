    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi mac80211 fix use-after-free in chanctx code In ieee80211_vif_use_reserved_context(), when we have an old context and the new contexts replace_state is set to IEEE80211_CHANCTX_REPLACE_NONE, we free the old context in ieee80211_vif_use_reserved_reassign(). Therefore, we cannot check the old_ctx anymore, so we should set it to NULL after this point. However, since the new_ctx replace state is clearly not IEEE80211_CHANCTX_REPLACES_OTHER, were not going to do anything else in this function and can just return to avoid accessing the freed old_ctx.",
