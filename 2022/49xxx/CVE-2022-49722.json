  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ice Fix memory corruption in VF driver Disable VFs RX/TX queues, when its disabled. VF can have queues enabled, when it requests a reset. If PF driver assumes that VF is disabled, while VF still has queues configured, VF may unmap DMA resources. In such scenario device still can map packets to memory, which ends up silently corrupting it. Previously, VF driver could experience memory corruption, which lead to crash [ 5119.170157] BUG unable to handle kernel paging request at 00001b9780003237 [ 5119.170166] PGD 0 P4D 0 [ 5119.170173] Oops 0002",
