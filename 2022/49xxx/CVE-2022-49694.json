    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved block disable the elevator int del_gendisk The elevator is only used for file system requests, which are stopped in del_gendisk. Move disabling the elevator and freeing the scheduler tags to the end of del_gendisk instead of doing that work in disk_release and blk_cleanup_queue to avoid a use after free on q->tag_set from disk_release as the tag_set might not be alive at that point. Move the blk_qos_exit call as well, as it just depends on the elevator exit and would be the only reason to keep the not exactly cheap queue freeze in disk_release.",
