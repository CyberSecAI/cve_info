    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved clk visconti prevent array overflow in visconti_clk_register_gates() This code was using -1 to represent that there was no reset function. Unfortunately, the -1 was stored in u8 so the if (clks[i].rs_id >= 0) condition was always true. This lead to an out of bounds access in visconti_clk_register_gates().",
