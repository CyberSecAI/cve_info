  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/i915/reset Fix error_state_read ptr + offset use Fix our pointer offset usage in error_state_read when there is no i915_gpu_coredump but buf offset is non-zero. This fixes a kernel page fault can happen when multiple tests are running concurrently in a loop and one is producing engine resets and consuming the i915 error_state dump while the other is forcing full GT resets. (takes a while to trigger).
