    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved riscv fix reserved memory setup Currently, RISC-V sets up reserved memory using the early copy of the device tree. As a result, when trying to get a reserved memory region using of_reserved_mem_lookup(), the pointer to reserved memory regions is using the early, pre-virtual-memory address which causes a kernel panic when trying to use the buffers name Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00000000401c31ac Oops",
