    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs zoned clone zoned device info when cloning a device When cloning a btrfs_device, were not cloning the associated btrfs_zoned_device_info structure of the device in case of a zoned filesystem. Later on this leads to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the devices zone_info for instance when setting a zone as active. This was uncovered by fstests testcase btrfs/161.",
