    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved clk qcom clk-rcg2 Update logic to calculate D value for RCG The display pixel clock has a requirement on certain newer platforms to support M/N as (2/3) and the final D value calculated results in underflow errors. As the current implementation does not check for D value is within the accepted range for a given M & N value. Update the logic to calculate the final D value based on the range.",
