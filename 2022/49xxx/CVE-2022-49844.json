    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved can dev fix skb drop check In commit a6d190f8c767 (can skb drop tx skb if in listen only mode) the priv->ctrlmode element is read even on virtual CAN interfaces that do not create the struct can_priv at startup. This out-of-bounds read may lead to CAN frame drops for virtual CAN interfaces like vcan and vxcan. This patch mainly reverts the original commit and adds a new helper for CAN interface drivers that provide the required information in struct can_priv. [mkl patch pch_can, too]",
