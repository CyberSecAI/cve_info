    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved can m_can m_can_{read_fifo,echo_tx_event}() shift timestamp to full 32 bits In commit 1be37d3b0414 (can m_can fix periph RX path use rx-offload to ensure skbs are sent from softirq context) the RX path for peripheral devices was switched to RX-offload. Received CAN frames are pushed to RX-offload together with a timestamp. RX-offload is designed to handle overflows of the timestamp correctly, if 32 bit timestamps are provided. The timestamps of m_can core are only 16 bits wide. So this patch shifts them to full 32 bit before passing them to RX-offload.",
