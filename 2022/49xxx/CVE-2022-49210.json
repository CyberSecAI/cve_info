    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved MIPS pgalloc fix memory leak caused by pgd_free() pgd page is freed by generic implementation pgd_free() since commit f9cb654cb550 (asm-generic pgalloc provide generic pgd_free()), however, there are scenarios that the system uses more than one page as the pgd table, in such cases the generic implementation pgd_free() wont be applicable anymore. For example, when PAGE_SIZE_4KB is enabled and MIPS_VA_BITS_48 is not enabled in a 64bit system, the macro PGD_ORDER will be set as 1, which will cause allocating two pages as the pgd table. Well, at the same time, the generic implementation pgd_free() just free one pgd page, which will result in the memory leak. The memory leak can be easily detected by executing shell command while true do ls > /dev/null grep MemFree /proc/meminfo done",
