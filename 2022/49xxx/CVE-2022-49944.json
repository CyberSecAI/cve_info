    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Revert usb typec ucsi add a common function ucsi_unregister_connectors() The recent commit 87d0e2f41b8c (usb typec ucsi add a common function ucsi_unregister_connectors()) introduced a regression that caused NULL dereference at reading the power supply sysfs. Its a stale sysfs entry that should have been removed but remains with NULL ops. The commit changed the error handling to skip the entries after a NULL con->wq, and this leaves the power device unreleased. For addressing the regression, the straight revert is applied here. Further code improvements can be done from the scratch again.",
