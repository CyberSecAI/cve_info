    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved LSM general protection fault in legacy_parse_param The usual LSM hook bail on fail scheme doesnt work for cases where a security module may return an error code indicating that it does not recognize an input. In this particular case Smack sees a mount option that it recognizes, and returns 0. A call to a BPF hook follows, which returns -ENOPARAM, which confuses the caller because Smack has processed its data. The SELinux hook incorrectly returns 1 on success. There was a time when this was correct, however the current expectation is that it return 0 on success. This is repaired.",
