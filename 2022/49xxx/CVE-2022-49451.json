    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved firmware arm_scmi Fix list protocols enumeration in the base protocol While enumerating protocols implemented by the SCMI platform using BASE_DISCOVER_LIST_PROTOCOLS, the number of returned protocols is currently validated in an improper way since the check employs a sum between unsigned integers that could overflow and cause the check itself to be silently bypassed if the returned value loop_num_ret is big enough. Fix the validation avoiding the addition.",
