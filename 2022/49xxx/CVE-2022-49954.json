    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Input iforce - wake up after clearing IFORCE_XMIT_RUNNING flag syzbot is reporting hung task at __input_unregister_device() [1], for iforce_close() waiting at wait_event_interruptible() with dev->mutex held is blocking input_disconnect_device() from __input_unregister_device(). It seems that the cause is simply that commit c2b27ef672992a20 (Input iforce - wait for command completion when closing the device) forgot to call wake_up() after clear_bit(). Fix this problem by introducing a helper that calls clear_bit() followed by wake_up_all().",
