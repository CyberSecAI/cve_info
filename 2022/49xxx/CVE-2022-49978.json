    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved fbdev fb_pm2fb Avoid potential divide by zero error In `do_fb_ioctl()` of fbmem.c, if cmd is FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO, var will be copied from user, then go through `fb_set_var()` and `info->fbops->fb_check_var()` which could may be `pm2fb_check_var()`. Along the path, `var->pixclock` wont be modified. This function checks whether reciprocal of `var->pixclock` is too high. If `var->pixclock` is zero, there will be a divide by zero error. So, it is necessary to check whether denominator is zero to avoid crash. As this bug is found by Syzkaller, logs are listed below. divide error in pm2fb_check_var Call Trace fb_set_var+0x367/0xeb0 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c1015 do_fb_ioctl+0x234/0x670 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c1110 fb_ioctl+0xdd/0x130 drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c1189",
