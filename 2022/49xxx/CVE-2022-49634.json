    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sysctl Fix data-races in proc_dou8vec_minmax(). A sysctl variable is accessed concurrently, and there is always a chance of data-race. So, all readers and writers need some basic protection to avoid load/store-tearing. This patch changes proc_dou8vec_minmax() to use READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() internally to fix data-races on the sysctl side. For now, proc_dou8vec_minmax() itself is tolerant to a data-race, but we still need to add annotations on the other subsystems side.",
