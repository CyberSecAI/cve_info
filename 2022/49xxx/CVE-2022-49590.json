    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved igmp Fix data-races around sysctl_igmp_llm_reports. While reading sysctl_igmp_llm_reports, it can be changed concurrently. Thus, we need to add READ_ONCE() to its readers. This test can be packed into a helper, so such changes will be in the follow-up series after net is merged into net-next. if (ipv4_is_local_multicast(pmc->multiaddr) && !READ_ONCE(net->ipv4.sysctl_igmp_llm_reports))",
