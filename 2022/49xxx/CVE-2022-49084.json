    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved qede confirm skb is allocated before using qede_build_skb() assumes build_skb() always works and goes straight to skb_reserve(). However, build_skb() can fail under memory pressure. This results in a kernel panic because the skb to reserve is NULL. Add a check in case build_skb() failed to allocate and return NULL. The NULL return is handled correctly in callers to qede_build_skb().",
