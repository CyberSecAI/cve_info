  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ath9k_htc fix uninit value bugs Syzbot reported 2 KMSAN bugs in ath9k. All of them are caused by missing field initialization. In htc_connect_service() svc_meta_len and pad are not initialized. Based on code it looks like in current skb there is no service data, so simply initialize svc_meta_len to 0. htc_issue_send() does not initialize htc_frame_hdrcontrol array. Based on firmware code, it will initialize it by itself, so simply zero whole array to make KMSAN happy Fail logs BUG KMSAN kernel-usb-infoleak in usb_submit_urb+0x6c1/0x2aa0 drivers/usb/core/urb.c430 usb_submit_urb+0x6c1/0x2aa0 drivers/usb/core/urb.c430 hif_usb_send_regout drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/hif_usb.c127 [inline] hif_usb_send+0x5f0/0x16f0 drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/hif_usb.c479 htc_issue_send drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/htc_hst.c34 [inline] htc_connect_service+0x143e/0x1960 drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/htc_hst.c275 ...
