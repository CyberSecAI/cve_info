    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/sched act_ct fix ref leak when switching zones When switching zones or network namespaces without doing a ct clear in between, it is now leaking a reference to the old ct entry. Thats because tcf_ct_skb_nfct_cached() returns false and tcf_ct_flow_table_lookup() may simply overwrite it. The fix is to, as the ct entry is not reusable, free it already at tcf_ct_skb_nfct_cached().",
