    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved can can327 can327_feed_frame_to_netdev() fix potential skb leak when netdev is down In can327_feed_frame_to_netdev(), it did not free the skb when netdev is down, and all callers of can327_feed_frame_to_netdev() did not free allocated skb too. That would trigger skb leak. Fix it by adding kfree_skb() in can327_feed_frame_to_netdev() when netdev is down. Not tested, just compiled.",
