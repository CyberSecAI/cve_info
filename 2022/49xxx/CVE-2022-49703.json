  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi ibmvfc Store vhost pointer during subcrq allocation Currently the back pointer from a queue to the vhost adapter isnt set until after subcrq interrupt registration. The value is available when a queue is first allocated and can/should be also set for primary and async queues as well as subcrqs. This fixes a crash observed during kexec/kdump on Power 9 with legacy XICS interrupt controller where a pending subcrq interrupt from the previous kernel can be replayed immediately upon IRQ registration resulting in dereference of a garbage backpointer in ibmvfc_interrupt_scsi(). Kernel attempted to read user page (58) - exploit attempt? (uid 0) BUG Kernel NULL pointer dereference on read at 0x00000058 Faulting instruction address 0xc008000003216a08 Oops Kernel access of bad area, sig 11",
