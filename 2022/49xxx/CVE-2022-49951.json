    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved firmware_loader Fix use-after-free during unregister In the following code within firmware_upload_unregister(), the call to device_unregister() could result in the dev_release function freeing the fw_upload_priv structure before it is dereferenced for the call to module_put(). This bug was found by the kernel test robot using CONFIG_KASAN while running the firmware selftests. device_unregister(&fw_sysfs->dev) module_put(fw_upload_priv->module) The problem is fixed by copying fw_upload_priv->module to a local variable for use when calling device_unregister().",
