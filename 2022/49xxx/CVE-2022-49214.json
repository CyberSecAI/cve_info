    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved powerpc/64s Dont use DSISR for SLB faults Since commit 46ddcb3950a2 (powerpc/mm Show if a bad page fault on data is read or write.) we use page_fault_is_write(regs->dsisr) in __bad_page_fault() to determine if the fault is for a read or write, and change the message printed accordingly. But SLB faults, aka Data Segment Interrupts, dont set DSISR (Data Storage Interrupt Status Register) to a useful value. All ISA versions from v2.03 through v3.1 specify that the Data Segment Interrupt sets DSISR to an undefined value. As far as I can see theres no mention of SLB faults setting DSISR in any BookIV content either. This manifests as accesses that should be a read being incorrectly reported as writes, for example, using the xmon dump command 0mon> d 0x5deadbeef0000000 5deadbeef0000000",
