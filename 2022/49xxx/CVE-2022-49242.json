    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC mxs Fix error handling in mxs_sgtl5000_probe This function only calls of_node_put() in the regular path. And it will cause refcount leak in error paths. For example, when codec_np is NULL, saif_np[0] and saif_np[1] are not NULL, it will cause leaks. of_node_put() will check if the node pointer is NULL, so we can call it directly to release the refcount of regular pointers.",
