    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net usb aqc111 Fix out-of-bounds accesses in RX fixup aqc111_rx_fixup() contains several out-of-bounds accesses that can be triggered by a malicious (or defective) USB device, in particular - The metadata array (desc_offset..desc_offset+2*pkt_count) can be out of bounds, causing OOB reads and (on big-endian systems) OOB endianness flips. - A packet can overlap the metadata array, causing a later OOB endianness flip to corrupt data used by a cloned SKB that has already been handed off into the network stack. - A packet SKB can be constructed whose tail is far beyond its end, causing out-of-bounds heap data to be considered part of the SKBs data. Found doing variant analysis. Tested it with another driver (ax88179_178a), since I dont have a aqc111 device to test it, but the code looks very similar.",
