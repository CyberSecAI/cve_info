    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM VMX Prevent RSB underflow before vmenter On VMX, there are some balanced returns between the time the guests SPEC_CTRL value is written, and the vmenter. Balanced returns (matched by a preceding call) are usually ok, but its at least theoretically possible an NMI with a deep call stack could empty the RSB before one of the returns. For maximum paranoia, dont allow *any* returns (balanced or otherwise) between the SPEC_CTRL write and the vmenter. [ bp Fix 32-bit build. ]",
