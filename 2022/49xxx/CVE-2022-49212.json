    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mtd rawnand atmel fix refcount issue in atmel_nand_controller_init The reference counting issue happens in several error handling paths on a refcounted object nc->dmac. In these paths, the function simply returns the error code, forgetting to balance the reference count of nc->dmac, increased earlier by dma_request_channel(), which may cause refcount leaks. Fix it by decrementing the refcount of specific object in those error paths.",
