    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nfc nfcmrvl Fix memory leak in nfcmrvl_play_deferred Similar to the handling of play_deferred in commit 19cfe912c37b (Bluetooth btusb Fix memory leak in play_deferred), we thought a patch might be needed here as well. Currently usb_submit_urb is called directly to submit deferred tx urbs after unanchor them. So the usb_giveback_urb_bh would failed to unref it in usb_unanchor_urb and cause memory leak. Put those urbs in tx_anchor to avoid the leak, and also fix the error handling.",
