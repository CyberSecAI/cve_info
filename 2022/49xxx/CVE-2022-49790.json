    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Input iforce - invert valid length check when fetching device IDs syzbot is reporting uninitialized value at iforce_init_device() [1], for commit 6ac0aec6b0a6 (Input iforce - allow callers supply data buffer when fetching device IDs) is checking that valid length is shorter than bytes to read. Since iforce_get_id_packet() stores valid length when returning 0, the caller needs to check that valid length is longer than or equals to bytes to read.",
