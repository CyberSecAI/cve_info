    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/hfi1 Prevent panic when SDMA is disabled If the hfi1 module is loaded with HFI1_CAP_SDMA off, a call to hfi1_write_iter() will dereference a NULL pointer and panic. A typical stack frame is sdma_select_user_engine [hfi1] hfi1_user_sdma_process_request [hfi1] hfi1_write_iter [hfi1] do_iter_readv_writev do_iter_write vfs_writev do_writev do_syscall_64 The fix is to test for SDMA in hfi1_write_iter() and fail the I/O with EINVAL.",
