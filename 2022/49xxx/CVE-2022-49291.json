    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ALSA pcm Fix races among concurrent hw_params and hw_free calls Currently we have neither proper check nor protection against the concurrent calls of PCM hw_params and hw_free ioctls, which may result in a UAF. Since the existing PCM stream lock cant be used for protecting the whole ioctl operations, we need a new mutex to protect those racy calls. This patch introduced a new mutex, runtime->buffer_mutex, and applies it to both hw_params and hw_free ioctl code paths. Along with it, the both functions are slightly modified (the mmap_count check is moved into the state-check block) for code simplicity.",
