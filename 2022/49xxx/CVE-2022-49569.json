    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved spi bcm2835 bcm2835_spi_handle_err() fix NULL pointer deref for non DMA transfers In case a IRQ based transfer times out the bcm2835_spi_handle_err() function is called. Since commit 1513ceee70f2 (spi bcm2835 Drop dma_pending flag) the TX and RX DMA transfers are unconditionally canceled, leading to NULL pointer derefs if ctlr->dma_tx or ctlr->dma_rx are not set. Fix the NULL pointer deref by checking that ctlr->dma_tx and ctlr->dma_rx are valid pointers before accessing them.",
