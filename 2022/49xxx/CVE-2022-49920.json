    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter nf_tables netlink notifier might race to release objects commit release path is invoked via call_rcu and it runs lockless to release the objects after rcu grace period. The netlink notifier handler might win race to remove objects that the transaction context is still referencing from the commit release path. Call rcu_barrier() to ensure pending rcu callbacks run to completion if the list of transactions to be destroyed is not empty.",
