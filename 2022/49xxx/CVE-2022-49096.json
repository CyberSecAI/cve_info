    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net sfc add missing xdp queue reinitialization After rx/tx ring buffer size is changed, kernel panic occurs when it acts XDP_TX or XDP_REDIRECT. When tx/rx ring buffer size is changed(ethtool -G), sfc driver reallocates and reinitializes rx and tx queues and their buffer (tx_queue->buffer). But it misses reinitializing xdp queues(efx->xdp_tx_queues). So, while it is acting XDP_TX or XDP_REDIRECT, it uses the uninitialized tx_queue->buffer. A new function efx_set_xdp_channels() is separated from efx_set_channels() to handle only xdp queues. Splat looks like",
