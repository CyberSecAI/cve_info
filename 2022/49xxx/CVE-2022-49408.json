    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 fix memory leak in parse_apply_sb_mount_options() If processing the on-disk mount options fails after any memory was allocated in the ext4_fs_context, e.g. s_qf_names, then this memory is leaked. Fix this by calling ext4_fc_free() instead of kfree() directly.
