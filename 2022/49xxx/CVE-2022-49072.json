    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved gpio Restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before initialization GPIO chip irq members are exposed before they could be completely initialized and this leads to race conditions. One such issue was observed for the gc->irq.domain variable which was accessed through the I2C interface in gpiochip_to_irq() before it could be initialized by gpiochip_add_irqchip(). This resulted in Kernel NULL pointer dereference. Following are the logs for reference - kernel Call Trace kernel gpiod_to_irq+0x53/0x70 kernel acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by+0x113/0x1f0 kernel i2c_acpi_get_irq+0xc0/0xd0 kernel i2c_device_probe+0x28a/0x2a0 kernel really_probe+0xf2/0x460 kernel RIP 0010gpiochip_to_irq+0x47/0xc0 To avoid such scenarios, restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before they are completely initialized.",
