  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/msm/mdp5 Return error code in mdp5_mixer_release when deadlock is detected There is a possibility for mdp5_get_global_state to return -EDEADLK when acquiring the modeset lock, but currently global_state in mdp5_mixer_release doesnt check for if an error is returned. To avoid a NULL dereference error, lets have mdp5_mixer_release check if an error is returned and propagate that error. Patchwork https//patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/485181/",
