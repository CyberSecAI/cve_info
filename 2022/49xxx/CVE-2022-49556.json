    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM SVM Use kzalloc for sev ioctl interfaces to prevent kernel data leak For some sev ioctl interfaces, the length parameter that is passed maybe less than or equal to SEV_FW_BLOB_MAX_SIZE, but larger than the data that PSP firmware returns. In this case, kmalloc will allocate memory that is the size of the input rather than the size of the data. Since PSP firmware doesnt fully overwrite the allocated buffer, these sev ioctl interface may return uninitialized kernel slab memory.",
