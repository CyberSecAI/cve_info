    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC SOF ipc3-topology Correct get_control_data for non bytes payload It is possible to craft a topology where sof_get_control_data() would do out of bounds access because it expects that it is only called when the payload is bytes type. Confusingly it also handles other types of controls, but the payload parsing implementation is only valid for bytes. Fix the code to count the non bytes controls and instead of storing a pointer to sof_abi_hdr in sof_widget_data (which is only valid for bytes), store the pointer to the data itself and add a new member to save the size of the data. In case of non bytes controls we store the pointer to the chanv itself, which is just an array of values at the end. In case of bytes control, drop the wrong cdata->data (wdata[i].pdata) check against NULL since it is incorrect and invalid in this context. The data is pointing to the end of cdata struct, so it should never be null.",
