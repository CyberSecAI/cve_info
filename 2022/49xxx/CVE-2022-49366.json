    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ksmbd fix reference count leak in smb_check_perm_dacl() The issue happens in a specific path in smb_check_perm_dacl(). When id and uid have the same value, the function simply jumps out of the loop without decrementing the reference count of the object posix_acls, which is increased by get_acl() earlier. This may result in memory leaks. Fix it by decreasing the reference count of posix_acls before jumping to label check_access_bits.",
