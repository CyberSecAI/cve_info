    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net asix add proper error handling of usb read errors Syzbot once again hit uninit value in asix driver. The problem still the same -- asix_read_cmd() reads less bytes, than was requested by caller. Since all read requests are performed via asix_read_cmd() lets catch usb related error there and add __must_check notation to be sure all callers actually check return value. So, this patch adds sanity check inside asix_read_cmd(), that simply checks if bytes read are not less, than was requested and adds missing error handling of asix_read_cmd() all across the driver code.",
