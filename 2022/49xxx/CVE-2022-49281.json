    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cifs fix handlecache and multiuser In multiuser each individual user has their own tcon structure for the share and thus their own handle for a cached directory. When we umount such a share we much make sure to release the pinned down dentry for each such tcon and not just the master tcon. Otherwise we will get nasty warnings on umount that dentries are still in use [ 3459.590047] BUG Dentry 00000000115c6f41{i=12000000019d95,n=/} still in use\\\\ (2) [unmount of cifs cifs] ...
