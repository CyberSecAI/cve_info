    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/huge_memory Fix xarray node memory leak If xas_split_alloc() fails to allocate the necessary nodes to complete the xarray entry split, it sets the xa_state to -ENOMEM, which xas_nomem() then interprets as Please allocate more memory, not as Please free any unnecessary memory (which was the intended outcome). Its confusing to use xas_nomem() to free memory in this context, so call xas_destroy() instead.",
