    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drivers usb host Fix deadlock in oxu_bus_suspend() There is a deadlock in oxu_bus_suspend(), which is shown below (Thread 1) | (Thread 2) | timer_action() oxu_bus_suspend() | mod_timer() spin_lock_irq() //(1) | (wait a time) ... | oxu_watchdog() del_timer_sync() | spin_lock_irq() //(2) (wait timer to stop) | ... We hold oxu->lock in position (1) of thread 1, and use del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler also need oxu->lock in position (2) of thread 2. As a result, oxu_bus_suspend() will block forever. This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of spin_lock_irq(), which could let timer handler to obtain the needed lock.",
