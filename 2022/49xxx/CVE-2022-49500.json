    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wl1251 dynamically allocate memory used for DMA With introduction of vmaped stacks, stack parameters can no longer be used for DMA and now leads to kernel panic. It happens at several places for the wl1251 (e.g. when accessed through SDIO) making it unuseable on e.g. the OpenPandora. We solve this by allocating temporary buffers or use wl1251_read32(). Tested on v5.18-rc5 with OpenPandora.",
