    "description": "TLS hostname verification cannot be enabled in the Pulsar Brokers Java Client, the Pulsar Brokers Java Admin Client, the Pulsar WebSocket Proxys Java Client, and the Pulsar Proxys Admin Client leaving intra-cluster connections and geo-replication connections vulnerable to man in the middle attacks, which could leak credentials, configuration data, message data, and any other data sent by these clients. The vulnerability is for both the pulsar+ssl protocol and HTTPS. An attacker can only take advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of a machine between the client and the server. The attacker must then actively manipulate traffic to perform the attack by providing the client with a cryptographically valid certificate for an unrelated host. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Broker, Proxy, and WebSocket Proxy versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4 2.8.0 to 2.8.3 2.9.0 to 2.9.2 2.10.0 2.6.4 and earlier.",
