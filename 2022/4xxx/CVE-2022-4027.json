    "description": "The SimplePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the postitem parameter manipulated during a forum response in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping that makes injecting object and embed tags possible. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages when responding to forum threads that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
