  "description": "The SimplePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL] cookie value in versions up to, and including, 6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.",
