    "description": "The Royal Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to insufficient access control in the wpr_fix_royal_compatibility AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.3.59. This allows any authenticated user, including those with subscriber-level permissions, to deactivate every plugin on the site unless it is part of an extremely limited hardcoded selection. This also switches the site to the royal-elementor-kit theme, potentially resulting in availability issues.",
