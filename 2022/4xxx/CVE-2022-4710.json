  "description": "The Royal Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.3.59, due to due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the wpr_ajax_search_link_target parameter in the data_fetch function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is occurring because sanitize_text_field is insufficient to prevent attribute-based Cross-Site Scripting",
