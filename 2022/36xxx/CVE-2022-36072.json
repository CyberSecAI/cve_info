    "description": "SilverwareGames.io is a social network for users to play video games online. In version 1.1.8 and prior, due to an unobvious feature of PHP, hashes generated by built-in functions and starting with the `0e` symbols were being handled as zero multiplied with the `e` number. Therefore, the hash value was equal to 0. The maintainers fixed this in version 1.1.9 by using `===` instead of `==` in comparisons where it is possible (e.g. on sign in/sign up handlers).",
