    "description": "Mozilla developers Bryce Seager van Dyk and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities present in Firefox 101. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 102.",
