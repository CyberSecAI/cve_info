    "description": "The Motorola MOSCAD Toolbox software through 2022-05-02 relies on a cleartext password. It utilizes an MDLC driver to communicate with MOSCAD/ACE RTUs for engineering purposes. Access to these communications is protected by a password stored in cleartext in the wmdlcdrv.ini driver configuration file. In addition, this password is used for access control to MOSCAD/STS projects protected with the Legacy Password feature. In this case, an insecure CRC of the password is present in the project file this CRC is validated against the password in the driver configuration file.",
