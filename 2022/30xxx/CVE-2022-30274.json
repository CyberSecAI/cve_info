    "description": "The Motorola ACE1000 RTU through 2022-05-02 uses ECB encryption unsafely. It can communicate with an XRT LAN-to-radio gateway by means of an embedded client. Credentials for accessing this gateway are stored after being encrypted with the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode using a hardcoded key. Similarly, the ACE1000 RTU can route MDLC traffic over Extended Command and Management Protocol (XCMP) and Network Layer (XNL) networks via the MDLC driver. Authentication to the XNL port is protected by TEA in ECB mode using a hardcoded key.",
