    "description": "The IEEE 802.11 specifications through 802.11ax allow physically proximate attackers to intercept (possibly cleartext) target-destined frames by spoofing a targets MAC address, sending Power Save frames to the access point, and then sending other frames to the access point (such as authentication frames or re-association frames) to remove the targets original security context. This behavior occurs because the specifications do not require an access point to purge its transmit queue before removing a clients pairwise encryption key.",
