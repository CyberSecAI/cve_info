    "description": "The default configuration of the New Atlanta BlueDragon administrative interface in MediaCAST 8 and earlier enables external TCP connections to port 10000, instead of connections only from 127.0.0.1, which makes it easier for remote attackers to have an unspecified impact via a TCP session.",
