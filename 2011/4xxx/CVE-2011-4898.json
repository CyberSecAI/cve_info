    "description": "wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component in WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier generates different error messages for requests lacking a dbname parameter depending on whether the MySQL credentials are valid, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force attacks via a series of requests with different uname and pwd parameters. NOTE the vendor disputes the significance of this issue also, it is unclear whether providing intentionally vague error messages during installation would be reasonable from a usability perspective",
