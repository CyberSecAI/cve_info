  "description": "Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.8 SP1 and SP2, and Windows Data Access Components (WDAC) 6.0, does not properly validate memory allocation for internal data structures, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, possibly via a large CacheSize property that triggers an integer wrap and a buffer overflow, aka ADO Record Memory Vulnerability.
