    "description": "The NetHTTPS module in libwww-perl (LWP) before 6.00, as used in WWWMechanize, LWPUserAgent, and other products, when running in environments that do not set the If-SSL-Cert-Subject header, does not enable full validation of SSL certificates by default, which allows remote attackers to spoof servers via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks involving hostnames that are not properly validated. NOTE it could be argued that this is a design limitation of the NetHTTPS API, and separate implementations should be independently assigned CVE identifiers for not working around this limitation. However, because this API was modified within LWP, a single CVE identifier has been assigned.",
