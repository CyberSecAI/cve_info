    "description": "The VEGAOpBitmapAddLine function in Opera before 10.61 does not properly initialize memory during processing of the SIZE attribute of a SELECT element, which allows remote attackers to trigger an invalid memory write operation, and consequently cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code, via a large integer attribute value.",
