  "description": "The bond_select_queue function in drivers/net/bonding/bond_main.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39, when a network device with a large number of receive queues is installed but the default tx_queues setting is used, does not properly restrict queue indexes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (BUG and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by sending network traffic.",
