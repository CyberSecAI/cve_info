  "description": "A locally locally exploitable DOS vulnerability was found in pax-linux versions 2.6.32.33-test79.patch, 2.6.38-test3.patch, and 2.6.37.4-test14.patch. A bad bounds check in arch_get_unmapped_area_topdown triggered by programs doing an mmap after a MAP_GROWSDOWN mmap will create an infinite loop condition without releasing the VM semaphore eventually leading to a system crash.",
