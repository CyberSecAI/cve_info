    "description": "A certain Debian patch for OpenSSH before 4.3p2-9etch3 on etch before 4.6p1-1 on sid and lenny and on other distributions such as SUSE uses functions that are not async-signal-safe in the signal handler for login timeouts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection slot exhaustion) via multiple login attempts.
