    "description": "The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (sctp) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.27 does not properly handle a protocol violation in which a parameter has an invalid length, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via unspecified vectors, related to sctp_sf_violation_paramlen, sctp_sf_abort_violation, sctp_make_abort_violation, and incorrect data types in function calls.",
