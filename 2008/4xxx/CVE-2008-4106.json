    "description": "WordPress before 2.6.2 does not properly handle MySQL warnings about insertion of username strings that exceed the maximum column width of the user_login column, and does not properly handle space characters when comparing usernames, which allows remote attackers to change an arbitrary users password to a random value by registering a similar username and then requesting a password reset, related to a SQL column truncation vulnerability. NOTE the attacker can discover the random password by also exploiting CVE-2008-4107.",
