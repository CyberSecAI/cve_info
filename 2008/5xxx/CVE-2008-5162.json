    "description": "The arc4random function in the kernel in FreeBSD 6.3 through 7.1 does not have a proper entropy source for a short time period immediately after boot, which makes it easier for attackers to predict the functions return values and conduct certain attacks against the GEOM framework and various network protocols, related to the Yarrow random number generator.",
