  "description": "mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.28-rc8, when strict overcommit is enabled and CONFIG_SECURITY is disabled, does not properly handle the export of shmemfs objects by knfsd, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and knfsd crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors. NOTE this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2010-1643.",
