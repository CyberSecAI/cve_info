    "description": "directory.php in AJchat 0.10 allows remote attackers to bypass input validation and conduct SQL injection attacks via a numeric parameter with a value matching the s parameters hash value, which prevents the associated $_GET[s] variable from being unset. NOTE it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix should be in PHP if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in AJChat.",
