    "description": "A buffer overflow in Synthesia before 10.7.5567, when a non-Latin locale is used, allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted MIDI file with malformed bytes. This file is mishandled during a deletion attempt. In Synthesia before 10.9, an improper path handling allows local attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted MIDI file with malformed bytes.",
