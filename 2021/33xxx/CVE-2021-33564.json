  "description": "An argument injection vulnerability in the Dragonfly gem before 1.4.0 for Ruby allows remote attackers to read and write to arbitrary files via a crafted URL when the verify_url option is disabled. This may lead to code execution. The problem occurs because the generate and process features mishandle use of the ImageMagick convert utility.",
