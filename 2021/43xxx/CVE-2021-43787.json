    "description": "Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions a prototype pollution vulnerability in the uploader module allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary data (i.e. javascript) into the DOM, theoretically allowing for an account takeover when used in conjunction with a path traversal vulnerability disclosed at the same time as this report. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.",
