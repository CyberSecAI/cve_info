    "description": "An issue was discovered in the fruity crate through 0.2.0 for Rust. Security-relevant validation of filename extensions is plausibly affected. Methods of NSString for conversion to a string may return a partial result. Because they call CStrfrom_ptr on a pointer to the string buffer, the string is terminated at the first \\0 byte, which might not be the end of the string.",
