    "description": "The GOautodial API prior to commit 3c3a979 made on October 13th, 2021 takes a user-supplied action parameter and appends a .php file extension to locate and load the correct PHP file to implement the API call. Vulnerable versions of GOautodial do not sanitize the user input that specifies the action. This permits an attacker to execute any PHP source file with a .php extension that is present on the disk and readable by the GOautodial web server process. Combined with CVE-2021-43175, it is possible for the attacker to do this without valid credentials. CVSS3.1/AVN/ACL/PRL/UIN/SU/CH/IH/AH/EP/RLO/RCC",
