    "description": "An issue was discovered in Couchbase Sync Gateway 2.7.0 through 2.8.2. The bucket credentials used to read and write data in Couchbase Server were insecurely being stored in the metadata within sync documents written to the bucket. Users with read access could use these credentials to obtain write access. (This issue does not affect clusters where Sync Gateway is authenticated with X.509 client certificates. This issue also does not affect clusters where shared bucket access is not enabled on Sync Gateway.)",
