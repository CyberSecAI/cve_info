    "description": "Heap buffer overflow in Clickhouses LZ4 compression codec when parsing a malicious query. There is no verification that the copy operations in the LZ4decompressImpl loop and especially the arbitrary copy operation wildCopy(op, ip, copy_end), dont exceed the destination buffers limits. This issue is very similar to CVE-2021-43304, but the vulnerable copy operation is in a different wildCopy call.",
