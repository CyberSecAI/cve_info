  "description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.8. A use-after-free in selinux_ptrace_traceme (aka the SELinux handler for PTRACE_TRACEME) could be used by local attackers to cause memory corruption and escalate privileges, aka CID-a3727a8bac0a. This occurs because of an attempt to access the subjective credentials of another task.",
