    "description": "An issue was discovered in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. This vulnerability allows the attacker to predict a DNS querys source port in order to send forged DNS response packets that will be accepted as valid answers to the DNS clients requests (without sniffing the specific request). Data is predictable because it is based on the time of day, and has too few bits.",
