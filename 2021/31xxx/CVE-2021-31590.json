  "description": "PwnDoc all versions until 0.4.0 (2021-08-23) has incorrect JSON Webtoken handling, leading to incorrect access control. With a valid JSON Webtoken that is used for authentication and authorization, a user can keep his admin privileges even if he is downgraded to the user privilege. Even after a users account is deleted, the user can still access the administration panel (and add or delete users) and has complete access to the system.",
