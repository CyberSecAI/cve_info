    "description": "Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as driver domains. Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage if a driver domain gets compromised, it doesnt have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected backends * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch 3, CVE-2021-28713",
