    "description": "An XSS vulnerability was discovered in python-lxmls clean module versions before 4.6.3. When disabling the safe_attrs_only and forms arguments, the Cleaner class does not remove the formaction attribute allowing for JS to bypass the sanitizer. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to run arbitrary JS code on users who interact with incorrectly sanitized HTML. This issue is patched in lxml 4.6.3.",
