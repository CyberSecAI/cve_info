    "description": "A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS, which only affects the release 18.4R2-S5, where a function is inconsistently implemented on Juniper Networks Junos QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series, and if storm-control enhanced is configured, can lead to the enhanced storm control filter group not be installed. It will cause storm control not to work hence allowing an attacker to cause high CPU usage or packet loss issues by sending a large amount of broadcast or unknown unicast packets arriving the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks QFX5100, QFX5110, QFX5120, QFX5200, QFX5210, EX4600, and EX4650, and QFX5100 with QFX 5e Series image installed.
