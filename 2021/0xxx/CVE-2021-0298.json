    "description": "A Race Condition in the show chassis pic command in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow an attacker to crash the port interface concentrator daemon (picd) process on the FPC, if the command is executed coincident with other system events outside the attackers control, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued execution of the CLI command, under precise conditions, could create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects all Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.1R2-EVO on PTX10003 and PTX10008 platforms. Junos OS is not affected by this vulnerability.",
