    "description": "The improper handling of client-side parameters in J-Web of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to perform a number of different malicious actions against a target device when a user is authenticated to J-Web. An attacker may be able to supersede existing parameters, including hardcoded parameters within the HTTP/S session, access and exploit variables, bypass web application firewall rules or input validation mechanisms, and otherwise alter and modify J-Webs normal behavior. An attacker may be able to transition victims to malicious web services, or exfiltrate sensitive information from otherwise secure web forms. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS All versions prior to 17.4R3-S3 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S12 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S6 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S4 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R3-S6 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S4 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S1 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S1 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S2, 19.4R3 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2.",
