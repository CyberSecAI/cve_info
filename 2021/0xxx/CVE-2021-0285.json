    "description": "An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series switches allows an attacker sending large amounts of legitimate traffic destined to the device to cause Interchassis Control Protocol (ICCP) interruptions, leading to an unstable control connection between the Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) nodes which can in turn lead to traffic loss. Continued receipt of this amount of traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An indication that the system could be impacted by this issue is the following log message DDOS_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION_SET Warning Host-bound traffic for protocol/exception LOCALNHaggregate exceeded its allowed bandwidth at fpc for times, started at This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S11 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S13, 17.4R3-S5 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8, 18.4R3-S7 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S2 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S3, 20.2R3 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R1-S1, 20.4R2.",
