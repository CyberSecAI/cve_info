    "description": "In _PMRCreate of the PowerVR kernel driver, a missing bounds check means it is possible to overwrite heap memory via PhysmemNewRamBackedPMR. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
