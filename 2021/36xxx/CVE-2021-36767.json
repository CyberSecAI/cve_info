    "description": "In Digi RealPort through 4.10.490, authentication relies on a challenge-response mechanism that gives access to the server password, making the protection ineffective. An attacker may send an unauthenticated request to the server. The server will reply with a weakly-hashed version of the servers access password. The attacker may then crack this hash offline in order to successfully login to the server.",
