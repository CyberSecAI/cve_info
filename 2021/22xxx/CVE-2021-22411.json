    "description": "There is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in some Huawei products. The code of a module have a bad judgment logic. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by performing multiple abnormal activities to trigger the bad logic and cause out-of-bounds write. This may compromise the normal service of the module.Affected product versions include NGFW Module versions V500R005C00SPC100,V500R005C00SPC200Secospace USG6300 versions V500R001C30SPC200,V500R001C30SPC600,V500R001C60SPC500,V500R005C00SPC100,V500R005C00SPC200Secospace USG6500 versions V500R001C30SPC200,V500R001C30SPC600,V500R001C60SPC500,V500R005C00SPC100,V500R005C00SPC200Secospace USG6600 versions V500R001C30SPC200,V500R001C30SPC600,V500R001C60SPC500,V500R005C00SPC100,V500R005C00SPC200USG9500 versions V500R001C60SPC500,V500R005C00SPC100,V500R005C00SPC200.",
