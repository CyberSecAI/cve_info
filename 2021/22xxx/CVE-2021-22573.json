    "description": "The vulnerability is that IDToken verifier does not verify if token is properly signed. Signature verification makes sure that the tokens payload comes from valid provider, not from someone else. An attacker can provide a compromised token with custom payload. The token will pass the validation on the client side. We recommend upgrading to version 1.33.3 or above",
