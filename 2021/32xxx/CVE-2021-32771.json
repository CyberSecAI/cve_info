    "description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. In affected versions it is possible to cause a buffer overflow when copying an IPv6 address prefix in the RPL-Classic implementation in Contiki-NG. In order to trigger the vulnerability, the Contiki-NG system must have joined an RPL DODAG. After that, an attacker can send a DAO packet with a Target option that contains a prefix length larger than 128 bits. The problem was fixed after the release of Contiki-NG 4.7. Users unable to upgrade may apply the patch in Contiki-NG PR #1615.",
