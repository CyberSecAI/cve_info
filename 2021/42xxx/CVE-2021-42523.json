    "description": "There are two Information Disclosure vulnerabilities in colord, and they lie in colord/src/cd-device-db.c and colord/src/cd-profile-db.c separately. They exist because the err_msg of sqlite3_exec is not releasing after use, while libxml2 emphasizes that the caller needs to release it.",
