    "description": "Prototype poisoning in function mapObjIndexed in Ramda 0.27.0 and earlier allows attackers to compromise integrity or availability of application via supplying a crafted object (that contains an own property __proto__) as an argument to the function. NOTE the vendor disputes this because the observed behavior only means that a user can create objects that the user didnt know would contain custom prototypes",
