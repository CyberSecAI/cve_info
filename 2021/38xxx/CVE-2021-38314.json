    "description": "The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress registered several AJAX actions available to unauthenticated users in the `includes` function in `redux-core/class-redux-core.php` that were unique to a given site but deterministic and predictable given that they were based on an md5 hash of the site URL with a known salt value of -redux and an md5 hash of the previous hash with a known salt value of -support. These AJAX actions could be used to retrieve a list of active plugins and their versions, the sites PHP version, and an unsalted md5 hash of sites `AUTH_KEY` concatenated with the `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`.",
