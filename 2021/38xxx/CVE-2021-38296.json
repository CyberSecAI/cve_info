    "description": "Apache Spark supports end-to-end encryption of RPC connections via spark.authenticate and spark.network.crypto.enabled. In versions 3.1.2 and earlier, it uses a bespoke mutual authentication protocol that allows for full encryption key recovery. After an initial interactive attack, this would allow someone to decrypt plaintext traffic offline. Note that this does not affect security mechanisms controlled by spark.authenticate.enableSaslEncryption, spark.io.encryption.enabled, spark.ssl, spark.ui.strictTransportSecurity. Update to Apache Spark 3.1.3 or later",
