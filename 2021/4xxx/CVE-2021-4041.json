    "description": "A flaw was found in ansible-runner. An improper escaping of the shell command, while calling the ansible_runner.interface.run_command, can lead to parameters getting executed as hosts shell command. A developer could unintentionally write code that gets executed in the host rather than the virtual environment.",
