    "description": "The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Content Injection in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking authorization protections, checks against users editing others posts, and lacking a security nonce, all on the wpfm_edit_file_title_desc AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit the content and title of every page on the site.",
