    "description": "The Envato Elements & Download and Template Kit Import plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient validation of file type upon extracting uploaded Zip files in the installFreeTemplateKit and uploadTemplateKitZipFile functions. This makes it possible for attackers with contributor-lever permissions and above to upload arbitrary files and potentially gain remote code execution in versions up to and including 1.0.13 of Template Kit Import and versions up to and including 2.0.10 of Envato Elements & Download.",
