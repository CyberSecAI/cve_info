    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in NX 1980 Series (All versions < V1984), Solid Edge SE2021 (All versions < SE2021MP8). The plmxmlAdapterIFC.dll contains an out-of-bounds read while parsing user supplied IFC files which could result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition or read sensitive information from memory locations.",
