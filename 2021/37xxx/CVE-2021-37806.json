    "description": "An SQL Injection vulnerability exists in https//phpgurukul.com Vehicle Parking Management System affected version 1.0. The system is vulnerable to time-based SQL injection on multiple endpoints. Based on the SLEEP(N) function payload that will sleep for a number of seconds used on the (1) editid , (2) viewid, and (3) catename parameters, the server response is about (N) seconds delay respectively which mean it is vulnerable to MySQL Blind (Time Based). An attacker can use sqlmap to further the exploitation for extracting sensitive information from the database.",
