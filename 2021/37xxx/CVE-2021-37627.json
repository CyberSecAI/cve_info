    "description": "Contao is an open source CMS that allows creation of websites and scalable web applications. In affected versions it is possible to gain privileged rights in the Contao back end. Installations are only affected if they have untrusted back end users who have access to the form generator. All users are advised to update to Contao 4.4.56, 4.9.18 or 4.11.7. As a workaround users may disable the form generator or disable the login for untrusted back end users.",
