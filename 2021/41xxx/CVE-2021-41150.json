    "description": "Tough provides a set of Rust libraries and tools for using and generating the update framework (TUF) repositories. The tough library, prior to 0.12.0, does not properly sanitize delegated role names when caching a repository, or when loading a repository from the filesystem. When the repository is cached or loaded, files ending with the .json extension could be overwritten with role metadata anywhere on the system. A fix is available in version 0.12.0. No workarounds to this issue are known.",
