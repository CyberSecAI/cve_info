    "description": "Nokogiri is a Rubygem providing HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parsers with XPath and CSS selector support. In Nokogiri v1.12.4 and earlier, on JRuby only, the SAX parser resolves external entities by default. Users of Nokogiri on JRuby who parse untrusted documents using any of these classes are affected NokogiriXMLSAXParse, NokogiriHTML4SAXParser or its alias NokogiriHTMLSAXParser, NokogiriXMLSAXPushParser, and NokogiriHTML4SAXPushParser or its alias NokogiriHTMLSAXPushParser. JRuby users should upgrade to Nokogiri v1.12.5 or later to receive a patch for this issue. There are no workarounds available for v1.12.4 or earlier. CRuby users are not affected.",
