    "description": "websda.c in GoAhead WebServer 2.1.8 has insufficient nonce entropy because the nonce calculation relies on the hardcoded onceuponatimeinparadise value, which does not follow the secret-data guideline for HTTP Digest Access Authentication in RFC 7616 section 3.3 (or RFC 2617 section 3.2.1). NOTE 2.1.8 is a version from 2003 however, the affected websda.c code appears in multiple derivative works that may be used in 2021. Recent GoAhead software is unaffected.",
