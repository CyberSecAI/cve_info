    "description": "Python discord bot is the community bot for the Python Discord community. In affected versions when a non-blacklisted URL and an otherwise triggering filter token is included in the same message the token filter does not trigger. This means that by including any non-blacklisted URL moderation filters can be bypassed. This issue has been resolved in commit 67390298852513d13e0213870e50fb3cff1424e0",
