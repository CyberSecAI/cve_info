    "description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. A specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB read on heap in the TFLite implementation of `Split_V`(https//github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c59c37e7b2d563967da813fa50fe20b21f4da683/tensorflow/lite/kernels/split_v.cc#L99). If `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the `SizeOfDimension` function(https//github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/102b211d892f3abc14f845a72047809b39cc65ab/tensorflow/lite/kernels/kernel_util.h#L148-L150) will access data outside the bounds of the tensor shape array. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
