    "description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. TFLites convolution code(https//github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/09c73bca7d648e961dd05898292d91a8322a9d45/tensorflow/lite/kernels/conv.cc) has multiple division where the divisor is controlled by the user and not checked to be non-zero. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.",
