    "description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. The BPF subsystem does not properly consider that resolved_ids and resolved_sizes are intentionally uninitialized in the vmlinux BPF Type Format (BTF), which can cause a system crash upon an unexpected access attempt (in map_create in kernel/bpf/syscall.c or check_btf_info in kernel/bpf/verifier.c), aka CID-350a5c4dd245.",
