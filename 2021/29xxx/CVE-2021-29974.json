    "description": "When network partitioning was enabled, e.g. as a result of Enhanced Tracking Protection settings, a TLS error page would allow the user to override an error on a domain which had specified HTTP Strict Transport Security (which implies that the error should not be override-able.) This issue did not affect the network connections, and they were correctly upgraded to HTTPS automatically. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 90.",
