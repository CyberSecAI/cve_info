  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of multiple Cisco Small Business Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to replay valid user session credentials and gain unauthorized access to the web-based management interface of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient expiration of session credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a man-in-the-middle attack against an affected device to intercept valid session credentials and then replaying the intercepted credentials toward the same device at a later time. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the web-based management interface with administrator privileges.",
