    "description": "In Zabbix from 4.0.x before 4.0.28rc1, 5.0.0alpha1 before 5.0.10rc1, 5.2.x before 5.2.6rc1, and 5.4.0alpha1 before 5.4.0beta2, the CControllerAuthenticationUpdate controller lacks a CSRF protection mechanism. The code inside this controller calls diableSIDValidation inside the init() method. An attacker doesnt have to know Zabbix user login credentials, but has to know the correct Zabbix URL and contact information of an existing user with sufficient privileges.",
