    "description": "The web server in InterNiche NicheStack through 4.0.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and networking outage) via an unexpected valid HTTP request such as OPTIONS. This occurs because the HTTP request handler enters a miscoded wbs_loop() debugger hook.",
