    "description": "When copying files with rsync, octorpki uses the -a flag 0, which forces rsync to copy binaries with the suid bit set as root. Since the provided service definition defaults to root ( https//github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/blob/master/package/octorpki.service ) this could allow for a vector, when combined with another vulnerability that causes octorpki to process a malicious TAL file, for a local privilege escalation.",
