    "description": "A privilege escalation flaw was found in OpenShift builder. During build time, credentials outside the build context are automatically mounted into the container image under construction. An OpenShift user, able to execute code during build time inside this container can re-use the credentials to overwrite arbitrary container images in internal registries and/or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. This affects github.com/openshift/builder v0.0.0-20210125201112-7901cb396121 and before.",
