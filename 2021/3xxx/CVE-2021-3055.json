    "description": "An improper restriction of XML external entity (XXE) reference vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS web interface enables an authenticated administrator to read any arbitrary file from the file system and send a specifically crafted request to the firewall that causes the service to crash.

This issue impacts PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.20 PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.14 PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.10 PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.6.
