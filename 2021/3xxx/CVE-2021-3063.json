    "description": "An improper handling of exceptional conditions vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect portal and gateway interfaces that enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to send specifically crafted traffic to a GlobalProtect interface that causes the service to stop responding. Repeated attempts to send this request result in denial of service to all PAN-OS services by restarting the device and putting it into maintenance mode.
