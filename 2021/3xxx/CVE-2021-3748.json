    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the virtio-net device of QEMU. It could occur when the descriptors address belongs to the non direct access region, due to num_buffers being set after the virtqueue elem has been unmapped. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash QEMU, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
