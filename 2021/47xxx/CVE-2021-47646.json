    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Revert Revert block, bfq honor already-setup queue merges A crash [1] happened to be triggered in conjunction with commit 2d52c58b9c9b (block, bfq honor already-setup queue merges). The latter was then reverted by commit ebc69e897e17 (Revert block, bfq honor already-setup queue merges). Yet, the reverted commit was not the one introducing the bug. In fact, it actually triggered a UAF introduced by a different commit, and now fixed by commit d29bd41428cf (block, bfq reset last_bfqq_created on group change). So, there is no point in keeping commit 2d52c58b9c9b (block, bfq honor already-setup queue merges) out. This commit restores it. [1] https//bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214503",
