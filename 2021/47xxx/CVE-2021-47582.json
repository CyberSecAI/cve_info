    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved USB core Make do_proc_control() and do_proc_bulk() killable The USBDEVFS_CONTROL and USBDEVFS_BULK ioctls invoke usb_start_wait_urb(), which contains an uninterruptible wait with a user-specified timeout value. If timeout value is very large and the device being accessed does not respond in a reasonable amount of time, the kernel will complain about Task X blocked for more than N seconds, as found in testing by syzbot INFO task syz-executor.08700 blocked for more than 143 seconds.
