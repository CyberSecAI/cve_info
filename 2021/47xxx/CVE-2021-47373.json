    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved irqchip/gic-v3-its Fix potential VPE leak on error In its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc, when its_vpe_init() returns an error, there is an off-by-one in the number of VPEs to be freed. Fix it by simply passing the number of VPEs allocated, which is the index of the loop iterating over the VPEs. [maz fixed commit message]",
