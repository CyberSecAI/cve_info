  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net qrtr fix OOB Read in qrtr_endpoint_post Syzbot reported slab-out-of-bounds Read in qrtr_endpoint_post. The problem was in wrong _size_ type if (len != ALIGN(size, 4) + hdrlen) goto err If size from qrtr_hdr is 4294967293 (0xfffffffd), the result of ALIGN(size, 4) will be 0. In case of len == hdrlen and size == 4294967293 in header this check wont fail and skb_put_data(skb, data + hdrlen, size) will read out of bound from data, which is hdrlen allocated block.",
