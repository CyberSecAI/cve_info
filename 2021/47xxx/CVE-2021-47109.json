  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved neighbour allow NUD_NOARP entries to be forced GCed IFF_POINTOPOINT interfaces use NUD_NOARP entries for IPv6. Its possible to fill up the neighbour table with enough entries that it will overflow for valid connections after that. This behaviour is more prevalent after commit 58956317c8de (neighbor Improve garbage collection) is applied, as it prevents removal from entries that are not NUD_FAILED, unless they are more than 5s old.",
