    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved soc/tegra regulators Fix locking up when voltage-spread is out of range Fix voltage coupler lockup which happens when voltage-spread is out of range due to a bug in the code. The max-spread requirement shall be accounted when CPU regulator doesnt have consumers. This problem is observed on Tegra30 Ouya game console once system-wide DVFS is enabled in a device-tree.",
