    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ethernet hisilicon hns hns_dsaf_misc fix a possible array overflow in hns_dsaf_ge_srst_by_port() The if statement if (port >= DSAF_GE_NUM) return limits the value of port less than DSAF_GE_NUM (i.e., 8). However, if the value of port is 6 or 7, an array overflow could occur port_rst_off = dsaf_dev->mac_cb[port]->port_rst_off because the length of dsaf_dev->mac_cb is DSAF_MAX_PORT_NUM (i.e., 6). To fix this possible array overflow, we first check port and if it is greater than or equal to DSAF_MAX_PORT_NUM, the function returns.",
