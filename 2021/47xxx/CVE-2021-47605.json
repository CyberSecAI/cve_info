    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vduse fix memory corruption in vduse_dev_ioctl() The config.offset comes from the user. There needs to a check to prevent it being out of bounds. The config.offset and dev->config_size variables are both type u32. So if the offset if out of bounds then the dev->config_size - config.offset subtraction results in a very high u32 value. The out of bounds offset can result in memory corruption.",
