  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved clk qcom ipq8074 fix PCI-E clock oops Fix PCI-E clock related kernel oops that are caused by a missing clock parent. pcie0_rchng_clk_src has num_parents set to 2 but only one parent is actually set via parent_hws, it should also have XO defined. This will cause the kernel to panic on a NULL pointer in clk_core_get_parent_by_index(). So, to fix this utilize clk_parent_data to provide gcc_xo_gpll0 parent data. Since there is already an existing static const char * const gcc_xo_gpll0[] used to provide the same parents via parent_names convert those users to clk_parent_data as well. Without this earlycon is needed to even catch the OOPS as it will reset the board before serial is initialized with the following [ 0.232279] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0000a00000000000 [ 0.232322] Mem abort info [ 0.239094] ESR = 0x96000004 [ 0.241778] EC = 0x25 DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits [ 0.244908] SET = 0, FnV = 0 [ 0.250377] EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 [ 0.253236] FSC = 0x04 level 0 translation fault [ 0.256277] Data abort info [ 0.261141] ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000004 [ 0.264262] CM = 0, WnR = 0 [ 0.267820] [0000a00000000000] address between user and kernel address ranges [ 0.270954] Internal error Oops 96000004",
