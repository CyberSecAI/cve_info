    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved can etas_es58x es58x_rx_err_msg() fix memory leak in error path In es58x_rx_err_msg(), if can->do_set_mode() fails, the function directly returns without calling netif_rx(skb). This means that the skb previously allocated by alloc_can_err_skb() is not freed. In other terms, this is a memory leak. This patch simply removes the return statement in the error branch and let the function continue. Issue was found with GCC -fanalyzer, please follow the link below for details.",
