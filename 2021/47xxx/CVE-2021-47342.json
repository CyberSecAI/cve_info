  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 fix possible UAF when remounting r/o a mmp-protected file system After commit 618f003199c6 (ext4 fix memory leak in ext4_fill_super), after the file system is remounted read-only, there is a race where the kmmpd thread can exit, causing sbi->s_mmp_tsk to point at freed memory, which the call to ext4_stop_mmpd() can trip over. Fix this by only allowing kmmpd() to exit when it is stopped via ext4_stop_mmpd(). Bug-Report-Link",
