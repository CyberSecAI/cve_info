    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved comedi ni_usb6501 fix NULL-deref in command paths The driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but had no sanity checks on the sizes. This can lead to zero-size-pointer dereferences or overflowed transfer buffers in ni6501_port_command() and ni6501_counter_command() if a (malicious) device has smaller max-packet sizes than expected (or when doing descriptor fuzz testing). Add the missing sanity checks to probe().",
