    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cfg80211 fix management registrations locking The management registrations locking was broken, the list was locked for each wdev, but cfg80211_mgmt_registrations_update() iterated it without holding all the correct spinlocks, causing list corruption. Rather than trying to fix it with fine-grained locking, just move the lock to the wiphy/rdev (still need the list on each wdev), we already need to hold the wdev lock to change it, so theres no contention on the lock in any case. This trivially fixes the bug since we hold one wdevs lock already, and now will hold the lock that protects all lists.",
