    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vduse check that offset is within bounds in get_config() This condition checks len but it does not check offset and that could result in an out of bounds read if offset > dev->config_size. The problem is that since both variables are unsigned the dev->config_size - offset subtraction would result in a very high unsigned value. I think these checks might not be necessary because len and offset are supposed to already have been validated using the vhost_vdpa_config_validate() function. But I do not know the code perfectly, and I like to be safe.",
