  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved kvm LAPIC Restore guard to prevent illegal APIC register access Per the SDM, any access that touches bytes 4 through 15 of an APIC register may cause undefined behavior and must not be executed. Worse, such an access in kvm_lapic_reg_read can result in a leak of kernel stack contents. Prior to commit 01402cf81051 (kvm LAPIC write down valid APIC registers), such an access was explicitly disallowed. Restore the guard that was removed in that commit.",
