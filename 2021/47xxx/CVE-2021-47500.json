    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iio mma8452 Fix trigger reference couting The mma8452 driver directly assigns a trigger to the struct iio_dev. The IIO core when done using this trigger will call `iio_trigger_put()` to drop the reference count by 1. Without the matching `iio_trigger_get()` in the driver the reference count can reach 0 too early, the trigger gets freed while still in use and a use-after-free occurs. Fix this by getting a reference to the trigger before assigning it to the IIO device.",
