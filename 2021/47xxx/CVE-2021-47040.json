    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved io_uring fix overflows checks in provide buffers Colin reported before possible overflow and sign extension problems in io_provide_buffers_prep(). As Linus pointed out previous attempt did nothing useful, see d81269fecb8ce (io_uring fix provide_buffers sign extension). Do that with help of check__overflow helpers. And fix struct io_provide_buflen type, as it doesnt make much sense to keep it signed.",
