  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net dsa fix a crash if ->get_sset_count() fails If ds->ops->get_sset_count() fails then it count is a negative error code such as -EOPNOTSUPP. Because i is an unsigned int, the negative error code is type promoted to a very high value and the loop will corrupt memory until the system crashes. Fix this by checking for error codes and changing the type of i to just int.",
