    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ath10k Fix a use after free in ath10k_htc_send_bundle In ath10k_htc_send_bundle, the bundle_skb could be freed by dev_kfree_skb_any(bundle_skb). But the bundle_skb is used later by bundle_skb->len. As skb_len = bundle_skb->len, my patch replaces bundle_skb->len to skb_len after the bundle_skb was freed.",
