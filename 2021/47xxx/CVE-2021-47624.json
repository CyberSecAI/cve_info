    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/sunrpc fix reference count leaks in rpc_sysfs_xprt_state_change The refcount leak issues take place in an error handling path. When the 3rd argument buf doesnt match with offline, online or remove, the function simply returns -EINVAL and forgets to decrease the reference count of a rpc_xprt object and a rpc_xprt_switch object increased by rpc_sysfs_xprt_kobj_get_xprt() and rpc_sysfs_xprt_kobj_get_xprt_switch(), causing reference count leaks of both unused objects. Fix this issue by jumping to the error handling path labelled with out_put when buf matches none of offline, online or remove.",
