    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/damon/dbgfs protect targets destructions with kdamond_lock DAMON debugfs interface iterates current monitoring targets in dbgfs_target_ids_read() while holding the corresponding kdamond_lock. However, it also destructs the monitoring targets in dbgfs_before_terminate() without holding the lock. This can result in a use_after_free bug. This commit avoids the race by protecting the destruction with the corresponding kdamond_lock.",
