    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved staging rtl8712 fix use-after-free in rtl8712_dl_fw Syzbot reported use-after-free in rtl8712_dl_fw(). The problem was in race condition between r871xu_dev_remove() ->ndo_open() callback. Its easy to see from crash log, that driver accesses released firmware in ->ndo_open() callback. It may happen, since driver was releasing firmware _before_ unregistering netdev. Fix it by moving unregister_netdev() before cleaning up resources.
