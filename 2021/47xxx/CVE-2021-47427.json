    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi iscsi Fix iscsi_task use after free Commit d39df158518c (scsi iscsi Have abort handler get ref to conn) added iscsi_get_conn()/iscsi_put_conn() calls during abort handling but then also changed the handling of the case where we detect an already completed task where we now end up doing a goto to the common put/cleanup code. This results in a iscsi_task use after free, because the common cleanup code will do a put on the iscsi_task. This reverts the goto and moves the iscsi_get_conn() to after weve checked if the iscsi_task is valid.",
