    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cfg80211 call cfg80211_stop_ap when switch from P2P_GO type If the userspace tools switch from NL80211_IFTYPE_P2P_GO to NL80211_IFTYPE_ADHOC via send_msg(NL80211_CMD_SET_INTERFACE), it does not call the cleanup cfg80211_stop_ap(), this leads to the initialization of in-use data. For example, this path re-init the sdata->assigned_chanctx_list while it is still an element of assigned_vifs list, and makes that linked list corrupt.",
