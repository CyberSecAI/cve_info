    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved video fbdev nvidiafb Use strscpy() to prevent buffer overflow Coverity complains of a possible buffer overflow. However, given the static scope of nvidia_setup_i2c_bus() it looks like that cant happen after examiniing the call sites. CID 19036 (#1 of 1) Copy into fixed size buffer (STRING_OVERFLOW) 1. fixed_size_dest You might overrun the 48-character fixed-size string chan->adapter.name by copying name without checking the length. 2. parameter_as_source Note This defect has an elevated risk because the source argument is a parameter of the current function. 89 strcpy(chan->adapter.name, name) Fix this warning by using strscpy() which will silence the warning and prevent any future buffer overflows should the names used to identify the channel become much longer.",
