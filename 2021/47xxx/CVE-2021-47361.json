  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mcb fix error handling in mcb_alloc_bus() There are two bugs 1) If ida_simple_get() fails then this code calls put_device(carrier) but we havent yet called get_device(carrier) and probably that leads to a use after free. 2) After device_initialize() then we need to use put_device() to release the bus. This will free the internal resources tied to the device and call mcb_free_bus() which will free the rest.",
