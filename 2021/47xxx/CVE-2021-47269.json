    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb dwc3 ep0 fix NULL pointer exception There is no validation of the index from dwc3_wIndex_to_dep() and we might be referring a non-existing ep and trigger a NULL pointer exception. In certain configurations we might use fewer eps and the index might wrongly indicate a larger ep index than existing. By adding this validation from the patch we can actually report a wrong index back to the caller. In our usecase we are using a composite device on an older kernel, but upstream might use this fix also. Unfortunately, I cannot describe the hardware for others to reproduce the issue as it is a proprietary implementation.
