    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved fbmem Do not delete the mode that is still in use The execution of fb_delete_videomode() is not based on the result of the previous fbcon_mode_deleted(). As a result, the mode is directly deleted, regardless of whether it is still in use, which may cause UAF. ================================================================== BUG KASAN use-after-free in fb_mode_is_equal+0x36e/0x5e0 \\ drivers/video/fbdev/core/modedb.c924 Read of size 4 at addr ffff88807e0ddb1c by task syz-executor.0/18962 CPU 2 PID 18962 Comm syz-executor.0 Not tainted 5.10.45-rc1+ #3 Hardware name QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS ...
