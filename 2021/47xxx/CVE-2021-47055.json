    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mtd require write permissions for locking and badblock ioctls MEMLOCK, MEMUNLOCK and OTPLOCK modify protection bits. Thus require write permission. Depending on the hardware MEMLOCK might even be write-once, e.g. for SPI-NOR flashes with their WP# tied to GND. OTPLOCK is always write-once. MEMSETBADBLOCK modifies the bad block table.",
