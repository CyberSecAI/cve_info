    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi core Put LLD module refcnt after SCSI device is released SCSI host release is triggered when SCSI device is freed. We have to make sure that the low-level device driver module wont be unloaded before SCSI host instance is released because shost->hostt is required in the release handler. Make sure to put LLD module refcnt after SCSI device is released. Fixes a kernel panic of BUG unable to handle page fault for address reported by Changhui and Yi.",
