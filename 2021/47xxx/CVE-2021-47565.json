    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi mpt3sas Fix kernel panic during drive powercycle test While looping over shosts sdev list it is possible that one of the drives is getting removed and its sas_target object is freed but its sdev object remains intact. Consequently, a kernel panic can occur while the driver is trying to access the sas_address field of sas_target object without also checking the sas_target object for NULL.",
