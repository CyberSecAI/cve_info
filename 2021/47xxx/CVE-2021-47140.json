    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iommu/amd Clear DMA ops when switching domain Since commit 08a27c1c3ecf (iommu Add support to change default domain of an iommu group) a user can switch a device between IOMMU and direct DMA through sysfs. This doesnt work for AMD IOMMU at the moment because dev->dma_ops is not cleared when switching from a DMA to an identity IOMMU domain. The DMA layer thus attempts to use the dma-iommu ops on an identity domain, causing an oops # echo 00000005.0 > /sys/sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000e/unbind # echo identity > /sys/bus/pci/devices/00000005.0/iommu_group/type # echo 00000005.0 > /sys/sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000e/bind ...
