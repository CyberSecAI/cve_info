    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolvedKVM x86 Ensure liveliness of nested VM-Enter fail tracepoint messageUse the __string() machinery provided by the tracing subystem to make acopy of the string literals consumed by the nested VM-Enter failedtracepoint. A complete copy is necessary to ensure that the tracepointcant outlive the data/memory it consumes and deference stale memory.Because the tracepoint itself is defined by kvm, if kvm-intel and/orkvm-amd are built as modules, the memory holding the string literalsdefined by the vendor modules will be freed when the module is unloaded,whereas the tracepoint and its data in the ring buffer will live untilkvm is unloaded (or indefinitely if kvm is built-in).This bug has existed since the tracepoint was added, but was recentlyexposed by a new check in tracing to detect exactly this type of bug. fmt %s%s current_buffer vmx_dirty_log_t-140127 [003] .... kvm_nested_vmenter_failed WARNING CPU 3 PID 140134 at kernel/trace/trace.c3759 trace_check_vprintf+0x3be/0x3e0 CPU 3 PID 140134 Comm less Not tainted 5.13.0-rc1-ce2e73ce600a-req #184 Hardware name ASUS Q87M-E/Q87M-E, BIOS 1102 03/03/2014 RIP 0010trace_check_vprintf+0x3be/0x3e0 Code 0b 44 8b 4c 24 1c e9 a9 fe ff ff c6 44 02 ff 00 49 8b 97 b0 20 RSP 0018ffffa895cc37bcb0 EFLAGS 00010282 RAX 0000000000000000 RBX ffffa895cc37bd08 RCX 0000000000000027 RDX 0000000000000027 RSI 00000000ffffdfff RDI ffff9766cfad74f8 RBP ffffffffc0a041d4 R08 ffff9766cfad74f0 R09 ffffa895cc37bad8 R10 0000000000000001 R11 0000000000000001 R12 ffffffffc0a041d4 R13 ffffffffc0f4dba8 R14 0000000000000000 R15 ffff976409f2c000 FS 00007f92fa200740(0000) GSffff9766cfac0000(0000) knlGS0000000000000000 CS 0010 DS 0000 ES 0000 CR0 0000000080050033 CR2 0000559bd11b0000 CR3 000000019fbaa002 CR4 00000000001726e0 Call Trace trace_event_printf+0x5e/0x80 trace_raw_output_kvm_nested_vmenter_failed+0x3a/0x60 [kvm] print_trace_line+0x1dd/0x4e0 s_show+0x45/0x150 seq_read_iter+0x2d5/0x4c0 seq_read+0x106/0x150 vfs_read+0x98/0x180 ksys_read+0x5f/0xe0 do_syscall_64+0x40/0xb0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae",
