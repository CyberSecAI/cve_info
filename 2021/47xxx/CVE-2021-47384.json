    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved hwmon (w83793) Fix NULL pointer dereference by removing unnecessary structure field If driver read tmp value sufficient for (tmp & 0x08) && (!(tmp & 0x80)) && ((tmp & 0x7) == ((tmp >> 4) & 0x7)) from device then Null pointer dereference occurs. (It is possible if tmp = 0b0xyz1xyz, where same literals mean same numbers) Also lm75[] does not serve a purpose anymore after switching to devm_i2c_new_dummy_device() in w83791d_detect_subclients(). The patch fixes possible NULL pointer dereference by removing lm75[]. Found by Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org). [groeck Dropped unnecessary continuation lines, fixed multi-line alignments]",
