    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC codecs wcd934x handle channel mappping list correctly Currently each channel is added as list to dai channel list, however there is danger of adding same channel to multiple dai channel list which endups corrupting the other list where its already added. This patch ensures that the channel is actually free before adding to the dai channel list and also ensures that the channel is on the list before deleting it. This check was missing previously, and we did not hit this issue as we were testing very simple usecases with sequence of amixer commands.",
