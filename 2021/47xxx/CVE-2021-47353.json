    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved udf Fix NULL pointer dereference in udf_symlink function In function udf_symlink, epos.bh is assigned with the value returned by udf_tgetblk. The function udf_tgetblk is defined in udf/misc.c and returns the value of sb_getblk function that could be NULL. Then, epos.bh is used without any check, causing a possible NULL pointer dereference when sb_getblk fails. This fix adds a check to validate the value of epos.bh.",
