    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Input appletouch - initialize work before device registration Syzbot has reported warning in __flush_work(). This warning is caused by work->func == NULL, which means missing work initialization. This may happen, since input_dev->close() calls cancel_work_sync(&dev->work), but dev->work initalization happens _after_ input_register_device() call. So this patch moves dev->work initialization before registering input device",
