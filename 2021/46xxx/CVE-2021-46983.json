    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nvmet-rdma Fix NULL deref when SEND is completed with error When running some traffic and taking down the link on peer, a retry counter exceeded error is received. This leads to nvmet_rdma_error_comp which tried accessing the cq_context to obtain the queue. The cq_context is no longer valid after the fix to use shared CQ mechanism and should be obtained similar to how it is obtained in other functions from the wc->qp.
