    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/damon/dbgfs fix struct pid leaks in dbgfs_target_ids_write() DAMON debugfs interface increases the reference counts of struct pids for targets from the target_ids file write callback (dbgfs_target_ids_write()), but decreases the counts only in DAMON monitoring termination callback (dbgfs_before_terminate()). Therefore, when target_ids file is repeatedly written without DAMON monitoring start/termination, the reference count is not decreased and therefore memory for the struct pid cannot be freed. This commit fixes this issue by decreasing the reference counts when target_ids is written.",
