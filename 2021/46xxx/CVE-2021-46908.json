    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Use correct permission flag for mixed signed bounds arithmetic We forbid adding unknown scalars with mixed signed bounds due to the spectre v1 masking mitigation. Hence this also needs bypass_spec_v1 flag instead of allow_ptr_leaks.",
