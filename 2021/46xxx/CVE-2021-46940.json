    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tools/power turbostat Fix offset overflow issue in index converting The idx_to_offset() function returns type int (32-bit signed), but MSR_PKG_ENERGY_STAT is u32 and would be interpreted as a negative number. The end result is that it hits the if (offset < 0) check in update_msr_sum() which prevents the timer callback from updating the stat in the background when long durations are used. The similar issue exists in offset_to_idx() and update_msr_sum(). Fix this issue by converting the int to off_t accordingly.",
