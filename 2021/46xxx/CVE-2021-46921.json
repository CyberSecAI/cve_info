    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved locking/qrwlock Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath() While this code is executed with the wait_lock held, a reader can acquire the lock without holding wait_lock. The writer side loops checking the value with the atomic_cond_read_acquire(), but only truly acquires the lock when the compare-and-exchange is completed successfully which isnt ordered. This exposes the window between the acquire and the cmpxchg to an A-B-A problem which allows reads following the lock acquisition to observe values speculatively before the write lock is truly acquired. Weve seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a xchg while holding the read lock, but the writer can see a value change out from under it.
