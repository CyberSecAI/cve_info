    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved kyber fix out of bounds access when preempted __blk_mq_sched_bio_merge() gets the ctx and hctx for the current CPU and passes the hctx to ->bio_merge(). kyber_bio_merge() then gets the ctx for the current CPU again and uses that to get the corresponding Kyber context in the passed hctx. However, the thread may be preempted between the two calls to blk_mq_get_ctx(), and the ctx returned the second time may no longer correspond to the passed hctx. This works accidentally most of the time, but it can cause us to read garbage if the second ctx came from an hctx with more ctxs than the first one (i.e., if ctx->index_hw[hctx->type] > hctx->nr_ctx). This manifested as this UBSAN array index out of bounds error reported by Jakub UBSAN array-index-out-of-bounds in ../kernel/locking/qspinlock.c1309 index 13106 is out of range for type long unsigned int [128] Call Trace dump_stack+0xa4/0xe5 ubsan_epilogue+0x5/0x40 __ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds.cold.13+0x2a/0x34 queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x476/0x480 do_raw_spin_lock+0x1c2/0x1d0 kyber_bio_merge+0x112/0x180 blk_mq_submit_bio+0x1f5/0x1100 submit_bio_noacct+0x7b0/0x870 submit_bio+0xc2/0x3a0 btrfs_map_bio+0x4f0/0x9d0 btrfs_submit_data_bio+0x24e/0x310 submit_one_bio+0x7f/0xb0 submit_extent_page+0xc4/0x440 __extent_writepage_io+0x2b8/0x5e0 __extent_writepage+0x28d/0x6e0 extent_write_cache_pages+0x4d7/0x7a0 extent_writepages+0xa2/0x110 do_writepag"
