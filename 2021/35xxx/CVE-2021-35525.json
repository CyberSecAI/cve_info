    "description": "PostSRSd before 1.11 allows a denial of service (subprocess hang) if Postfix sends certain long data fields such as multiple concatenated email addresses. NOTE the PostSRSd maintainer acknowledges theoretically, this error should never occur ... Im not sure if theres a reliable way to trigger this condition by an external attacker, but it is a security bug in PostSRSd nevertheless.",
