  "description": "The Tatsu WordPress plugin before 3.3.12 add_custom_font action can be used without prior authentication to upload a rogue zip file which is uncompressed under the WordPresss upload directory. By adding a PHP shell with a filename starting with a dot ., this can bypass extension control implemented in the plugin. Moreover, there is a race condition in the zip extraction process which makes the shell file live long enough on the filesystem to be callable by an attacker.",
