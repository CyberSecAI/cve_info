  "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Solid Edge SE2020 (All versions < SE2020MP13), Solid Edge SE2020 (All versions < SE2020MP14), Solid Edge SE2021 (All Versions < SE2021MP4). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files. This could result in an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-12529)",
