    "description": "An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to self sign an ODF document, with a signature untrusted by the target, then modify it to change the signature algorithm to an invalid (or unknown to LibreOffice) algorithm and LibreOffice would incorrectly present such a signature with an unknown algorithm as a valid signature issued by a trusted person This issue affects LibreOffice from 7.0 before 7.0.5, from 7.1 before 7.1.1.",
