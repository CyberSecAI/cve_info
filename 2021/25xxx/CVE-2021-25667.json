    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in RUGGEDCOM RM1224 (All versions >= V4.3 and = V4.3 and = V4.3 and = V2.0 and < V2.1.3), SCALANCE XB-200 (All versions < V4.1), SCALANCE XC-200 (All versions < V4.1), SCALANCE XF-200BA (All versions < V4.1), SCALANCE XM400 (All versions < V6.2), SCALANCE XP-200 (All versions < V4.1), SCALANCE XR-300WG (All versions < V4.1), SCALANCE XR500 (All versions < V6.2). Affected devices contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of STP BPDU frames that could allow a remote attacker to trigger a denial-of-service condition or potentially remote code execution. Successful exploitation requires the passive listening feature of the device to be active.",
