    "description": "The editor of the WP Page Builder WordPress plugin before 1.2.4 allows lower-privileged users to insert unfiltered HTML, including JavaScript, into pages via the Raw HTML widget and the Custom HTML widgets (though the custom HTML widget requires sending a crafted request - it appears that this widget uses some form of client side validation but not server side validation), all of which are added via the page_builder_data parameter when performing the wppb_page_save AJAX action. It is also possible to insert malicious JavaScript via the wppb_page_css parameter (this can be done by closing out the style tag and opening a script tag) when performing the wppb_page_save AJAX action.",
