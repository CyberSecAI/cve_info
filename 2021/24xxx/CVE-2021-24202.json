    "description": "In the Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.1.4, the heading widget (includes/widgets/heading.php) accepts a header_size parameter. Although the element control lists a fixed set of possible html tags, it is possible for a user with Contributor or above permissions to send a modified save_builder request with this parameter set to script and combined with a title parameter containing JavaScript, which will then be executed when the saved page is viewed or previewed.",
