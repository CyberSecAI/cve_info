    "description": "In the Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.1.4, the accordion widget (includes/widgets/accordion.php) accepts a title_html_tag parameter. Although the element control lists a fixed set of possible html tags, it is possible for a user with Contributor or above permissions to send a modified save_builder request containing JavaScript in the title_html_tag parameter, which is not filtered and is output without escaping. This JavaScript will then be executed when the saved page is viewed or previewed.",
