    "description": "The Verse-O-Matic WordPress plugin through 4.1.1 does not have any CSRF checks in place, allowing attackers to make logged in administrators do unwanted actions, such as add/edit/delete arbitrary verses and change the settings. Due to the lack of sanitisation in the settings and verses, this could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues",
