  "description": "The User Registration, User Profile, Login & Membership ProfilePress (Formerly WP User Avatar) WordPress plugin before 3.1.11s widget for tabbed login/register was not properly escaped and could be used in an XSS attack which could lead to wp-admin access. Further, the plugin in several places assigned $_POST as $_GET which meant that in some cases this could be replicated with just $_GET parameters and no need for $_POST values.",
