    "description": "Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Spring Boot (ACSB) from version 1.1.0 before version 2.1.3 Atlassian Connect Spring Boot is a Java Spring Boot package for building Atlassian Connect apps. Authentication between Atlassian products and the Atlassian Connect Spring Boot app occurs with a server-to-server JWT or a context JWT. Atlassian Connect Spring Boot versions from version 1.1.0 before version 2.1.3 erroneously accept context JWTs in lifecycle endpoints (such as installation) where only server-to-server JWTs should be accepted, permitting an attacker to send authenticated re-installation events to an app.",
