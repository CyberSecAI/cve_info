    "description": "PyBitmessage through 0.6.3.2 allows attackers to write screen captures to Potentially Unwanted Directories via a crafted apinotifypath value. NOTE the discoverer states security mitigation may not be necessary as there is no evidence yet that these screen intercepts are actually transported away from the local host. NOTE it is unclear whether there are any common use cases in which apinotifypath is controlled by an attacker",
