    "description": "XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStreams security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStreams default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.",
