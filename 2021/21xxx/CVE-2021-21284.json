    "description": "In Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability involving the --userns-remap option in which access to remapped root allows privilege escalation to real root. When using --userns-remap, if the root user in the remapped namespace has access to the host filesystem they can modify files under /var/lib/docker/ that cause writing files with extended privileges. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent privilege escalation from remapped user.",
