    "description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for internet of things devices. In verions prior to 4.6, an attacker can perform a denial-of-service attack by triggering an infinite loop in the processing of IPv6 neighbor solicitation (NS) messages. This type of attack can effectively shut down the operation of the system because of the cooperative scheduling used for the main parts of Contiki-NG and its communication stack. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.6. Users can apply the patch for this vulnerability out-of-band as a workaround.",
