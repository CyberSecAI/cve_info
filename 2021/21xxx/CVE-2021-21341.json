    "description": "XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected who followed the recommendation to setup XStreams security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStreams default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.",
