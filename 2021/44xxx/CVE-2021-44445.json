  "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT Utilities (All versions < V13.1.1.0), JTTK (All versions < V11.1.1.0). JTTK library in affected products contains an out of bounds write past the fixed-length heap-based buffer while parsing specially crafted JT files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-15054)",
