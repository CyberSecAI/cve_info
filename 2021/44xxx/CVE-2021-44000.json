  "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2.0.7), Solid Edge SE2021 (All versions < SE2021MP9), Solid Edge SE2022 (All versions < SE2022MP1), Teamcenter Visualization V13.1 (All versions < V13.1.0.9), Teamcenter Visualization V13.2 (All versions < V13.2.0.7), Teamcenter Visualization V13.3 (All versions < V13.3.0.1). The plmxmlAdapterSE70.dll contains an out of bounds write past the fixed-length heap-based buffer while parsing specially crafted PAR files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-15053)",
