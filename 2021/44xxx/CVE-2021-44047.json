    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists when reading a DWF/DWFX file using Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2022.11. The specific issue exists with parsing DWF/DWFX files. Crafted data in a DWF/DWFX file and lack of proper validation of input data can trigger a write operation past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
