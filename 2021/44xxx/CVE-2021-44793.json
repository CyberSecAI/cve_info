    "description": "Single Connect does not perform an authorization check when using the sc-reports-ui module. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to access the device configuration page and export the data to an external file. The exploitation of this vulnerability might allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information including the database credentials. Since the database runs with high privileges it is possible to execute commands with the attained credentials.",
