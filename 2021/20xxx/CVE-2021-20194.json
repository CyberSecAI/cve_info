    "description": "There is a vulnerability in the linux kernel versions higher than 5.2 (if kernel compiled with config params CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y , CONFIG_BPF=y , CONFIG_CGROUPS=y , CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF=y , CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY not set, and BPF hook to getsockopt is registered). As result of BPF execution, the local user can trigger bug in __cgroup_bpf_run_filter_getsockopt() function that can lead to heap overflow (because of non-hardened usercopy). The impact of attack could be deny of service or possibly privileges escalation.",
