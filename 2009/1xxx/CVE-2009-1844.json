    "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Drupal 5.x before 5.18 and 6.x before 6.12 allow (1) remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted UTF-8 byte sequences that are treated as UTF-7 by Internet Explorer 6 and 7, which are not properly handled in the HTML exports of books feature and (2) allow remote authenticated users with administer taxonomy permissions to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the help text of an arbitrary vocabulary. NOTE vector 1 exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-1575.",
