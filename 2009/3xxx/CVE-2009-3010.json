    "description": "Mozilla Firefox 3.0.13 and earlier, 3.5, 3.6 a1 pre, and 3.7 a1 pre SeaMonkey 1.1.17 and Mozilla 1.7.x and earlier do not properly block data URIs in Refresh headers in HTTP responses, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to (1) injecting a Refresh header that contains JavaScript sequences in a datatext/html URI or (2) entering a datatext/html URI with JavaScript sequences when specifying the content of a Refresh header. NOTE in some product versions, the JavaScript executes outside of the context of the HTTP site.",
