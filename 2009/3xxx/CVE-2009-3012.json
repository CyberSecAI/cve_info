    "description": "Mozilla Firefox 3.0.13 and earlier, 3.5, 3.6 a1 pre, and 3.7 a1 pre does not properly block data URIs in Location headers in HTTP responses, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to (1) injecting a Location header that contains JavaScript sequences in a datatext/html URI or (2) entering a datatext/html URI with JavaScript sequences when specifying the content of a Location header. NOTE the JavaScript executes outside of the context of the HTTP site.",
