    "description": "XAMPP installs multiple packages with insecure default passwords, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via (1) the lampp default password for the nobody account within the included ProFTPD installation, (2) a blank default password for the root account within the included MySQL installation, (3) a blank default password for the pma account within the phpMyAdmin installation, and possibly other unspecified passwords. NOTE this was originally reported as a problem in DFLabs PTK, but this issue affects any product that is installed within the XAMPP environment, and should not be viewed as a vulnerability within that product. NOTE DFLabs states that PTK is intended for use in a laboratory with no contact from / to internet.",
