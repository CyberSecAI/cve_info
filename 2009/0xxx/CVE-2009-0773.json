    "description": "The JavaScript engine in Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.7, Thunderbird before 2.0.0.21, and SeaMonkey 1.1.15 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a splice of an array that contains some non-set elements, which causes jsarray.cpp to pass an incorrect argument to the ResizeSlots function, which triggers memory corruption (2) vectors related to js_DecompileValueGenerator, jsopcode.cpp, __defineSetter__, and watch, which triggers an assertion failure or a segmentation fault and (3) vectors related to gczeal, __defineSetter__, and watch, which triggers a hang.",
