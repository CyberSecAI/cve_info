    "description": "Mozilla Necko, as used in Firefox, SeaMonkey, and other applications, performs DNS prefetching of domain names contained in links within local HTML documents, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine the network location of the applications user by logging DNS requests. NOTE the vendor disputes the significance of this issue, stating I dont think we necessarily need to worry about that case.",
