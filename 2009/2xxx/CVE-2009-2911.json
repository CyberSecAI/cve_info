    "description": "SystemTap 1.0, when the --unprivileged option is used, does not properly restrict certain data sizes, which allows local users to (1) cause a denial of service or gain privileges via a print operation with a large number of arguments that trigger a kernel stack overflow, (2) cause a denial of service via crafted DWARF expressions that trigger a kernel stack frame overflow, or (3) cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via vectors that trigger creation of large unwind tables, related to Common Information Entry (CIE) and Call Frame Instruction (CFI) records.",
