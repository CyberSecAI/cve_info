    "description": "The execve function in the Linux kernel, possibly 2.6.30-rc6 and earlier, does not properly clear the current->clear_child_tid pointer, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly gain privileges via a clone system call with CLONE_CHILD_SETTID or CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID enabled, which is not properly handled during thread creation and exit.",
