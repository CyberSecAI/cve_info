  "description": "The d_delete function in fs/ecryptfs/inode.c in eCryptfs in the Linux kernel 2.6.31 allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPS) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors that cause a negative dentry and trigger a NULL pointer dereference, as demonstrated via a Mutt temporary directory in an eCryptfs mount.",
