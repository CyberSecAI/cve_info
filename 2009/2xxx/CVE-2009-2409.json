    "description": "The Network Security Services (NSS) library before 3.12.3, as used in Firefox GnuTLS before 2.6.4 and 2.7.4 OpenSSL 0.9.8 through 0.9.8k and other products support MD2 with X.509 certificates, which might allow remote attackers to spoof certificates by using MD2 design flaws to generate a hash collision in less than brute-force time. NOTE the scope of this issue is currently limited because the amount of computation required is still large.",
