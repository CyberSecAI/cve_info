    "description": "Stream.cc in Xpdf, as used in products such as gpdf, kpdf, pdftohtml, poppler, teTeX, CUPS, libextractor, and others, allows attackers to modify memory and possibly execute arbitrary code via a DCTDecode stream with (1) a large number of components value that is not checked by DCTStreamreadBaselineSOF or DCTStreamreadProgressiveSOF, (2) a large Huffman table index value that is not checked by DCTStreamreadHuffmanTables, and (3) certain uses of the scanInfo.numComps value by DCTStreamreadScanInfo.",
