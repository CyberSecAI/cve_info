    "description": "Zyxel P2000W Version 1 VOIP WIFI Phone Wj.00.10 uses hardcoded IP addresses for its DNS servers, which could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or hijack Zyxel phones by attacking or spoofing the hardcoded DNS servers. NOTE it could be argued that this issue reflects an inherent limitation of DNS itself, so perhaps it should not be included in CVE.",
