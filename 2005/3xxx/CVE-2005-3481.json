    "description": "Cisco IOS 12.0 to 12.4 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a heap-based buffer overflow in system timers. NOTE this issue does not correspond to a specific vulnerability, rather a general weakness that only increases the feasibility of exploitation of any vulnerabilities that might exist. Such design-level weaknesses normally are not included in CVE, so perhaps this issue should be REJECTed.",
