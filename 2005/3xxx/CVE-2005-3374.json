    "description": "Multiple interpretation error in F-Prot 3.16c allows remote attackers to bypass virus scanning via a file such as BAT, HTML, and EML with an MZ magic byte sequence which is normally associated with EXE, which causes the file to be treated as a safe type that could still be executed as a dangerous file type by applications on the end system, as demonstrated by a triple headed program that contains EXE, EML, and HTML content, aka the magic byte bug.",
