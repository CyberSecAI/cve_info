    "description": "Interpretation conflict in includes/mainfile.php in PHP-Nuke 7.9 and later allows remote attackers to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by replacing the > in the tag with a <, which bypasses the regular expressions that sanitize the data, but is automatically corrected by many web browsers. NOTE it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a design limitation of many web browsers if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in PHP-Nuke.",
