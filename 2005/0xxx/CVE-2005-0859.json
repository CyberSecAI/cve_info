  "description": "PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in CzarNews 1.13b allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the tpath parameter to (1) headlines.php or (2) news.php. NOTE some sources have reported the dir parameter as being affected however, this is likely a cut-and-paste error from the wrong section of the original vulnerability report. Also, the news.php version was later reported to be in 1.12 through 1.14.",
