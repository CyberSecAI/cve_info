    "description": "Thunderbird before 0.9, when running on Windows systems, uses the default handler when processing javascript links, which invokes Internet Explorer and may expose the Thunderbird user to vulnerabilities in the version of Internet Explorer that is installed on the users system. NOTE since the invocation between multiple products is a common practice, and the vulnerabilities inherent in multi-product interactions are not easily enumerable, this issue might be REJECTED in the future.",
