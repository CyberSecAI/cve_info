    "description": "Sudo 1.6.8p7 on SuSE Linux 9.3, and possibly other Linux distributions, allows local users to gain privileges by using sudo to call su, then entering a blank password and hitting CTRL-C. NOTE SuSE and multiple third-party researchers have not been able to replicate this issue, stating Sudo catches SIGINT and returns an empty string for the password so I dont see how this could happen unless the users actual password was empty.",
