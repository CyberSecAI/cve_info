    "description": "The CSPSourceschemeMatches function in WebKit/Source/core/frame/csp/CSPSource.cpp in the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82, does not apply http 80 policies to https 443 URLs and does not apply ws 80 policies to wss 443 URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine whether a specific HSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report. NOTE this vulnerability is associated with a specification change after CVE-2016-1617 resolution.",
