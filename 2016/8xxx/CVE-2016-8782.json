    "description": "Huawei CloudEngine 12800 V100R003C00, V100R003C10, V100R005C00, V100R005C10, V100R006C00 have a memory leak vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker may send specific Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) packets to the devices repeatedly. Due to improper validation of some specific fields of the packet, the LDP processing module does not release the memory, resulting in memory leak.",
