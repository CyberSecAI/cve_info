    "description": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.1-rev11. Script code can be embedded to RSS feeds using a URL notation. In case a user clicks the corresponding link at the RSS reader of App Suite, code gets executed at the context of the user. Malicious script code can be executed within a users context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). The attacker needs to reside within the same context to make this attack work.",
