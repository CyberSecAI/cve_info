    "description": "It was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.11-rc8 that root can gain direct access to an internal keyring, such as .dns_resolver in RHEL-7 or .builtin_trusted_keys upstream, by joining it as its session keyring. This allows root to bypass module signature verification by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.",
