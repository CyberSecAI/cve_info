    "description": "In BMC Patrol before 9.13.10.02, the binary listguests64 is configured with the setuid bit. However, when executing it, it will look for a binary named virsh using the PATH environment variable. The listguests64 program will then run virsh using root privileges. This allows local users to elevate their privileges to root.",
