The vulnerability is present in the Ioctl system call with the command HYPRLOFS_ADD_ENTRIES when dealing with native file systems. An attacker can craft an input that can cause a buffer overflow in the nm variable leading to an out of bounds memory access and could result in potential privilege escalation. This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2016-9034.",
