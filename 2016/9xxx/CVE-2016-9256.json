    "description": "In F5 BIG-IP 12.1.0 through 12.1.2, permissions enforced by iControl can lag behind the actual permissions assigned to a user if the role_map is not reloaded between the time the permissions are changed and the time of the users next request. This is a race condition that occurs rarely in normal usage the typical period in which this is possible is limited to at most a few seconds after the permission change.",
