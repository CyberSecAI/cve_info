    "description": "The NETGEAR WNR2000v5 router allows an administrator to perform sensitive actions by invoking the apply.cgi URL on the web server of the device. This special URL is handled by the embedded web server (uhttpd) and processed accordingly. The web server also contains another URL, apply_noauth.cgi, that allows an unauthenticated user to perform sensitive actions on the device. This functionality can be exploited to change the router settings (such as the answers to the password-recovery questions) and achieve remote code execution.",
