    "description": "marked is an application that is meant to parse and compile markdown. Due to the way that marked 0.3.5 and earlier parses input, specifically HTML entities, its possible to bypass markeds content injection protection (`sanitize true`) to inject a `javascript` URL. This flaw exists because `&#xNNanything` gets parsed to what it could and leaves the rest behind, resulting in just `anything` being left.",
