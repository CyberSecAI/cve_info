    "description": "Pivotal Spring Framework through 5.3.16 suffers from a potential remote code execution (RCE) issue if used for Java deserialization of untrusted data. Depending on how the library is implemented within a product, this issue may or not occur, and authentication may be required. NOTE the vendors position is that untrusted data is not an intended use case. The products behavior will not be changed because some users rely on deserialization of trusted data.",
