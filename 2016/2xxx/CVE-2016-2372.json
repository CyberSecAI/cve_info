  "description": "An information leak exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent via the server could potentially result in an out-of-bounds read. A malicious user, server, or man-in-the-middle attacker can send an invalid size for a file transfer which will trigger an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This could result in a denial of service or copy data from memory to the file, resulting in an information leak if the file is sent to another user.",
