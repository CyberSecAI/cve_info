    "description": "The Javascript Same Origin Policy (SOP), as implemented in (1) Netscape, (2) Mozilla, and (3) Internet Explorer, allows a remote web server to access HTTP and SOAP/XML content from restricted sites by mapping the malicious servers parent DNS domain name to the restricted site, loading a page from the restricted site into one frame, and passing the information to the attacker-controlled frame, which is allowed because the document.domain of the two frames matches on the parent domain.",
