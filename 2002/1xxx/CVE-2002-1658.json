    "description": "Buffer overflow in htdigest in Apache 1.3.26 and 1.3.27 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long user argument. NOTE since htdigest is normally only locally accessible and not setuid or setgid, there are few attack vectors which would lead to an escalation of privileges, unless htdigest is executed from a CGI program. Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.",
