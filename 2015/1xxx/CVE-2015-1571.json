    "description": "The CAPWAP DTLS protocol implementation in Fortinet FortiOS 5.0 Patch 7 build 4457 uses the same certificate and private key across different customers installations, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers by leveraging the Fortinet_Factory certificate and private key. NOTE FG-IR-15-002 says The Fortinet_Factory certificate is unique to each device ... An attacker cannot therefore stage a MitM attack.",
