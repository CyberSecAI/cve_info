NOTE the previous information is from the January 2015 CPU. Oracle has not commented on the researchers claim that the PUBLIC role is granted the INDEX privilege for the DUAL table during a seeded install, which allows remote authenticated users to gain SYSDBA privileges and execute arbitrary code.",
