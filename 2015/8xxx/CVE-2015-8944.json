    "description": "The ioresources_init function in kernel/resource.c in the Linux kernel through 4.7, as used in Android before 2016-08-05 on Nexus 6 and 7 (2013) devices, uses weak permissions for /proc/iomem, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading this file, aka Android internal bug 28814213 and Qualcomm internal bug CR786116. NOTE the permissions may be intentional in most non-Android contexts.",
