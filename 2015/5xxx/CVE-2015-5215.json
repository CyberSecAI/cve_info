    "description": "The default configuration of the Jinja templating engine used in the Identity Provider (IdP) server in Ipsilon 0.1.0 before 1.0.1 does not enable auto-escaping, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via template variables. NOTE This may be a duplicate of CVE-2015-5216. Moreover, the Jinja development team does not enable auto-escape by default for performance issues as explained in https//jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/master/faq/#why-is-autoescaping-not-the-default.",
