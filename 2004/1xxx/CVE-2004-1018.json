    "description": "Multiple integer handling errors in PHP before 4.3.10 allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions, cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code via (1) a negative offset value to the shmop_write function, (2) an integer overflow/underflow in the pack function, or (3) an integer overflow/underflow in the unpack function. NOTE this issue was originally REJECTed by its CNA before publication, but that decision is in active dispute. This candidate may change significantly in the future as a result of further discussion.",
