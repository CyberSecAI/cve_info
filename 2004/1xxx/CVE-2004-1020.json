    "description": "The addslashes function in PHP 4.3.9 does not properly escape a NULL (/0) character, which may allow remote attackers to read arbitrary files in PHP applications that contain a directory traversal vulnerability in require or include statements, but are otherwise protected by the magic_quotes_gpc mechanism. NOTE this issue was originally REJECTed by its CNA before publication, but that decision is in active dispute. This candidate may change significantly in the future as a result of further discussion.",
