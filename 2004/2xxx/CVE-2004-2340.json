NOTE the original vulnerability report contains several significant inconsistencies that make it unclear whether the report is accurate, including (1) PB-DB is really the PunkBuster Screenshot Database and not PunkBuster itself (2) there is no apparent association between PunkBuster and Punky Brewster (3) the claimed source code is not anywhere in Alpha 6.",
