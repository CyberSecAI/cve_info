  "description": "Integer overflow in pixbuf_create_from_xpm (io-xpm.c) in the XPM image decoder for gtk+ 2.4.4 (gtk2) and earlier, and gdk-pixbuf before 0.22, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain n_col and cpp values that enable a heap-based buffer overflow. NOTE this identifier is ONLY for gtk+. It was incorrectly referenced in an advisory for a different issue (CVE-2004-0687).",
