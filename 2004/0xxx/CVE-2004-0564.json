    "description": "Roaring Penguin pppoe (rp-ppoe), if installed or configured to run setuid root contrary to its design, allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files. NOTE the developer has publicly disputed the claim that this is a vulnerability because pppoe is NOT designed to run setuid-root. Therefore this identifier applies *only* to those configurations and installations under which pppoe is run setuid root despite the developers warnings.",
