    "description": "PHP treats unknown methods such as PoSt as a GET request, which could allow attackers to intended access restrictions if PHP is running on a server that passes on all methods, such as Apache httpd 2.0, as demonstrated using a Limit directive. NOTE this issue has been disputed by the Apache security team, saying It is by design that PHP allows scripts to process any request method. A script which does not explicitly verify the request method will hence be processed as normal for arbitrary methods. It is therefore expected behaviour that one cannot implement per-method access control using the Apache configuration alone, which is the assumption made in this report.",
