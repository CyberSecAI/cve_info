    "description": "The mremap system call (do_mremap) in Linux kernel 2.4.x before 2.4.21, and possibly other versions before 2.4.24, does not properly perform bounds checks, which allows local users to cause a denial of service and possibly gain privileges by causing a remapping of a virtual memory area (VMA) to create a zero length VMA, a different vulnerability than CAN-2004-0077.",
