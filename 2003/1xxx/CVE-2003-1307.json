    "description": "The mod_php module for the Apache HTTP Server allows local users with write access to PHP scripts to send signals to the servers process group and use the servers file descriptors, as demonstrated by sending a STOP signal, then intercepting incoming connections on the servers TCP port. NOTE the PHP developer has disputed this vulnerability, saying The opened file descriptors are opened by Apache. It is the job of Apache to protect them ... Not a bug in PHP.",
