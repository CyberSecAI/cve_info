    "description": "The undocumented TRACK method in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 returns the content of the original request in the body of the response, which makes it easier for remote attackers to steal cookies and authentication credentials, or bypass the HttpOnly protection mechanism, by using TRACK to read the contents of the HTTP headers that are returned in the response, a technique that is similar to cross-site tracing (XST) using HTTP TRACE.",
