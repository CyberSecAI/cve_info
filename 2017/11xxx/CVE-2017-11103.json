    "description": "Heimdal before 7.4 allows remote attackers to impersonate services with Orpheus Lyre attacks because it obtains service-principal names in a way that violates the Kerberos 5 protocol specification. In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from the encrypted version stored in enc_part instead of the unencrypted version stored in ticket. Use of the unencrypted version provides an opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks. NOTE this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed Heimdal code it does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.",
