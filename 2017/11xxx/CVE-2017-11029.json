    "description": "In android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android, with all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, camera application triggers user-memory-access issue as the Camera CPP module Linux driver directly accesses the application provided buffer, which resides in user space. An unchecked userspace value (ioctl_ptr->len) is used to copy contents to a kernel buffer which can lead to kernel buffer overflow.",
