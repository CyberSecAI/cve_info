    "description": "main/streams/xp_socket.c in PHP 7.x before 2017-03-07 misparses fsockopen calls, such as by interpreting fsockopen(127.0.0.180, 443) as if the address/port were 127.0.0.180443, which is later truncated to 127.0.0.180. This behavior has a security risk if the explicitly provided port number (i.e., 443 in this example) is hardcoded into an application as a security policy, but the hostname argument (i.e., 127.0.0.180 in this example) is obtained from untrusted input.",
