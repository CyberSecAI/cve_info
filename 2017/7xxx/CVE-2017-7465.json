    "description": "It was found that the JAXP implementation used in JBoss EAP 7.0 for XSLT processing is vulnerable to code injection. An attacker could use this flaw to cause remote code execution if they are able to provide XSLT content for parsing. Doing a transform in JAXP requires the use of a javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory. If the FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING feature is set to true, it mitigates this vulnerability.",
