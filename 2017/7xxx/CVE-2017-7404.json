    "description": "On the D-Link DIR-615 before v20.12PTb04, if a victim logged in to the Routers Web Interface visits a malicious site from another Browser tab, the malicious site then can send requests to the victims Router without knowing the credentials (CSRF). An attacker can host a page that sends a POST request to Form2File.htm that tries to upload Firmware to victims Router. This causes the router to reboot/crash resulting in Denial of Service. An attacker may succeed in uploading malicious Firmware.",
