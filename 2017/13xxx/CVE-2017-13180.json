    "description": "In the onQueueFilled function of SoftAVCDec, there is a possible out-of-bounds write due to a use after free if a bad header causes the decoder to get caught in a loop while another thread frees the memory its accessing. This could lead to a local elevation of privilege enabling code execution as a privileged process with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product Android. Versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1. Android ID A-66969349.",
