    "description": "The deserialize function in serialize-to-js through 1.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via vectors involving an Immediately Invoked Function Expression function() substring, as demonstrated by a function(){console.log( call or a simple infinite loop. NOTE the vendor agrees that denial of service can occur but notes that deserialize is explicitly listed as harmful within the README.md file",
