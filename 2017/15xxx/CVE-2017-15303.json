    "description": "In CPUID CPU-Z before 1.43, there is an arbitrary memory write that results directly in elevation of privileges, because any program running on the local machine (while CPU-Z is running) can issue an ioctl 0x9C402430 call to the kernel-mode driver (e.g., cpuz141_x64.sys for version 1.41).",
