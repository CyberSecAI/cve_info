The vulnerability is a result of untrusted input that is used to calculate an array index the calculation occurs in the image conversion module, when processing GIF files. The vulnerability leads to an operation that can write to a memory location that is outside of the memory addresses allocated for the data structure. The specific scenario leads to a write access to a memory location that does not belong to the relevant process address space.",
