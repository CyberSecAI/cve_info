    "description": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent Outside In Filters). The supported version that is affected is 8.5.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with access to the physical communication segment attached to the hardware where the Oracle Outside In Technology executes to compromise Oracle Outside In Technology. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Outside In Technology. Note Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.7 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.0/AVA/ACL/PRL/UIN/SU/CN/IN/AH).",
