    "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent Serialization). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE 6u161, 7u151, 8u144 and 9 Java SE Embedded 8u144. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, JRockit. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, JRockit. Note This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.0/AVN/ACL/PRN/UIN/SU/CN/IN/AL).",
