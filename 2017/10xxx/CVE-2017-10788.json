    "description": "The DBDmysql module through 4.043 for Perl allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering (1) certain error responses from a MySQL server or (2) a loss of a network connection to a MySQL server. The use-after-free defect was introduced by relying on incorrect Oracle mysql_stmt_close documentation and code examples.",
