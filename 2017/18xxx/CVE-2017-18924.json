    "description": "oauth2-server (aka node-oauth2-server) through 3.1.1 implements OAuth 2.0 without PKCE. It does not prevent authorization code injection. This is similar to CVE-2020-7692. NOTE the vendor states As RFC7636 is an extension, I think the claim in the Readme of RFC 6749 compliant is valid and not misleading and I also therefore wouldnt describe this as a vulnerability with the library per se.",
