    "description": "If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host, and a specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet can cause that server or client to perform an out-of-bounds read, usually resulting in a crash. For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305 users should upgrade to 1.1.0d. For Openssl 1.0.2, the crash can be triggered when using RC4-MD5 users who have not disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.",
