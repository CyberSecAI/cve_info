    "timestamp": "2024-12-11T16:08:24.783251+00:00",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software (15.4 through 15.6) and Cisco IOS XE Software (3.7 through 3.18, and 16) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation on certain crafted packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet to a device that is running a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release that supports the ANI feature. A device must meet two conditions to be affected by this vulnerability (1) the device must be running a version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software that supports ANI (regardless of whether ANI is configured) and (2) the device must have a reachable IPv6 interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload. Cisco Bug IDs CSCvc42729.",
