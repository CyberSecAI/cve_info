  "description": "An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1100 and DCS-1130 devices. The binary orthrus in /sbin folder of the device handles all the UPnP connections received by the device. It seems that the binary performs a sprintf operation at address 0x0000A3E4 with the value in the command line parameter -f and stores it on the stack. Since there is no length check, this results in corrupting the registers for the function sub_A098 which results in memory corruption.",
