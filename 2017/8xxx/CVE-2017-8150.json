  "description": "The boot loaders of P10 and P10 Plus Huawei mobile phones with software the versions before Victoria-L09AC605B162, the versions before Victoria-L29AC605B162, the versions before Vicky-L29AC605B162 have an arbitrary memory write vulnerability due to the lack of parameter validation. An attacker with the root privilege of an Android system may trick a user into installing a malicious APP. The APP can modify specific data to cause arbitrary memory writing in the next system reboot, causing continuous system reboot or arbitrary code execution.",
