    "description": "Some Huawei smartphones with software AGS-L09C233B019,AGS-W09C233B019,KOB-L09C233B017,KOB-W09C233B012 have a type confusion vulnerability. The program initializes a variable using one type, but it later accesses that variable using a type that is different with the original type when do certain register operation. Successful exploit could result in buffer overflow then may cause malicious code execution.",
