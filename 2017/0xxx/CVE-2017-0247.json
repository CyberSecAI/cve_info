    "description": "A denial of service vulnerability exists when the ASP.NET Core fails to properly validate web requests. NOTE Microsoft has not commented on third-party claims that the issue is that the TextEncoder.EncodeCore function in the System.Text.Encodings.Web package in ASP.NET Core Mvc before 1.0.4 and 1.1.x before 1.1.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by leveraging failure to properly calculate the length of 4-byte characters in the Unicode Non-Character range.",
