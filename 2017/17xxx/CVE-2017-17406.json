  "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Netgain Enterprise Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within an exposed RMI registry, which listens on TCP ports 1800 and 1850 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-4753.",
