    "description": "tools/url_handler.pl in TIN 2.4.1 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE a third party has reported that this is intentional behavior, because the documentation states url_handler.pl was designed to work together with tin which only issues shell escaped absolute URLs.",
