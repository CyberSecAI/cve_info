  "description": "It was found that the Linux kernels Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation before 2.6.22.17 used the IPv4-only inet_sk_rebuild_header() function for both IPv4 and IPv6 DCCP connections, which could result in memory corruptions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.",
