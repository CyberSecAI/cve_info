  "description": "An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the LvVariantUnflatten functionality in 64-bit versions of LabVIEW before 2015 SP1 f7 Patch and 2016 before f2 Patch. A specially crafted VI file can cause a user controlled value to be used as a loop terminator resulting in internal heap corruption. An attacker controlled VI file can be used to trigger this vulnerability, exploitation could lead to remote code execution.",
