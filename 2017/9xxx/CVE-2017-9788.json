    "description": "In Apache httpd before 2.2.34 and 2.4.x before 2.4.27, the value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type Digest was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no = assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault in other cases resulting in denial of service.",
