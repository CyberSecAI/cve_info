    "description": "An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides UPnP services that are available on port 3480 and can also be accessed via port 80 using the url /port_3480. It seems that the UPnP services provide request_image as one of the service actions for a normal user to retrieve an image from a camera that is controlled by the controller. It seems that the URL parameter passed in the query string is not sanitized and is stored on the stack which allows an attacker to overflow the buffer. The function LUGeneric_IP_Camera_ManagerREQ_Image is activated when the lu_request_image is passed as the id parameter in query string. This function then calls LUGeneric_IP_Camera_ManagerGetUrlFromArguments and passes a pointer to the function where it will be allowed to store the value from the URL parameter. This pointer is passed as the second parameter $a2 to the function LUGeneric_IP_Camera_ManagerGetUrlFromArguments. However, neither the callee or the caller in this case performs a simple length check and as a result an attacker who is able to send more than 1336 characters can easily overflow the values stored on the stack including the $RA value and thus execute code on the device.",
