    "description": "An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. By sniffing for specific packets on the localhost, plaintext passwords can be obtained as they are typed into Sunny Explorer by the user. These passwords can then be used to compromise the overall device. NOTE the vendor reports that exploitation likelihood is low because these packets are usually sent only once during installation. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected",
