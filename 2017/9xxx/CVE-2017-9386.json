  "description": "An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a script file called get_file.sh which allows a user to retrieve any file stored in the cmh-ext folder on the device. However, the filename parameter is not validated correctly and this allows an attacker to directory traverse outside the /cmh-ext folder and read any file on the device. It is necessary to create the folder cmh-ext on the device which can be executed by an attacker first in an unauthenticated fashion and then execute a directory traversal attack.",
