    "description": "An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a shell script called connect.sh which is supposed to return a specific cookie for the user when the user is authenticated to https//home.getvera.com. One of the parameters retrieved by this script is RedirectURL. However, the application lacks strict input validation of this parameter and this allows an attacker to execute the client-side code on this application.",
