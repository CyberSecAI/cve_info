    "description": "An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. An attacker can use Sunny Explorer or the SMAdata2+ network protocol to update the device firmware without ever having to authenticate. If an attacker is able to create a custom firmware version that is accepted by the inverter, the inverter is compromised completely. This allows the attacker to do nearly anything for example, giving access to the local OS, creating a botnet, using the inverters as a stepping stone into companies, etc. NOTE the vendor reports that this attack has always been blocked by a final integrity and compatibility check. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected",
