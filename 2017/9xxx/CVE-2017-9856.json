    "description": "An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. Sniffed passwords from SMAdata2+ communication can be decrypted very easily. The passwords are encrypted using a very simple encryption algorithm. This enables an attacker to find the plaintext passwords and authenticate to the device. NOTE the vendor reports that only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected",
