    "description": "An issue was discovered in sysPass 2.x before 2.1, in which an algorithm was never sufficiently reviewed by cryptographers. The fact that inc/SP/Core/Crypt.class is using the MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256() function (the 256-bit block version of Rijndael, not AES) instead of MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128 (real AES) could help an attacker to create unknown havoc in the remote system.",
