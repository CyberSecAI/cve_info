  "description": "The HTTP web-management application on Edgewater Networks Edgemarc appliances has a hidden page that allows for user-defined commands such as specific iptables routes, etc., to be set. You can use this page as a web shell essentially to execute commands, though you get no feedback client-side from the web application if the command is valid, it executes. An example is the wget command. The page that allows this has been confirmed in firmware as old as 2006.",
