    "description": "A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Decryption and Inspection feature of Cisco Firepower System Software 5.4.0, 5.4.1, 6.0.0, 6.1.0, 6.2.0, 6.2.1, and 6.2.2 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the SSL policy for decrypting and inspecting traffic on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to unexpected interaction with Known Key and Decrypt and Resign configuration settings of SSL policies when the affected software receives unexpected SSL packet headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL packet through an affected device in a valid SSL session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the SSL decryption and inspection policy for the affected system, which could allow traffic to flow through the system without being inspected.
