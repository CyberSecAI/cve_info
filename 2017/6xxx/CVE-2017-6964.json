    "description": "dmcrypt-get-device, as shipped in the eject package of Debian and Ubuntu, does not check the return value of the (1) setuid or (2) setgid function, which might cause dmcrypt-get-device to execute code, which was intended to run as an unprivileged user, as root. This affects eject through 2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-13.1 on Debian, eject before 2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-13.1ubuntu0.16.10.1 on Ubuntu 16.10, eject before 2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-13.1ubuntu0.16.04.1 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, eject before 2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-13.1ubuntu0.14.04.1 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and eject before 2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-9ubuntu0.1 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.",
