    "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow unauthenticated, remote attackers to gain information that could allow them to access scheduled customer meetings. The vulnerability is due to an incomplete configuration of the robots.txt file on customer-hosted WebEx solutions and occurs when the Short URL functionality is not activated. All releases of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server later than release 2.5MR4 provide this functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via an exposed parameter to search for indexed meeting information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain scheduled meeting information and potentially allow the attacker to attend scheduled, customer meetings. This vulnerability affects the following releases of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8. Cisco Bug IDs CSCve25950.",
