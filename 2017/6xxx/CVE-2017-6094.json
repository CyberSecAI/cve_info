    "description": "CPEs used by subscribers on the access network receive their individual configuration settings from a central GAPS instance. A CPE identifies itself by the MAC address of its WAN interface and a certain chk value (48bit) derived from the MAC. The algorithm used to compute the chk was disclosed by reverse engineering the CPEs firmware. As a result, it is possible to forge valid chk values for any given MAC address and therefore receive the configuration settings of other subscribers CPEs. The configuration settings often contain sensitive values, for example credentials (username/password) for VoIP services. This issue affects Genexis B.V. GAPS up to 7.2.",
