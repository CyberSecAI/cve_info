    "description": "An issue was discovered in icoutils 0.31.1. A buffer overflow was observed in the decode_ne_resource_id function in the restable.c source file. This is happening because the len parameter for memcpy is not checked for size and thus becomes a negative integer in the process, resulting in a failed memcpy. This affects wrestool.",
