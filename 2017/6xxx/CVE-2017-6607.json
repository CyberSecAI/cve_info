  "description": "A vulnerability in the DNS code of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload or corrupt the information present in the devices local DNS cache. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in handling crafted DNS response messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by triggering a DNS request from the Cisco ASA Software and replying with a crafted response. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition or corruption of the local DNS cache information. Note Only traffic directed to the affected device can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed or transparent firewall mode and single or multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software running on the following products Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls, Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv), Cisco Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module, Cisco ISA 3000 Industrial Security Appliance. Fixed versions 9.1(7.12) 9.2(4.18) 9.4(3.12) 9.5(3.2) 9.6(2.2). Cisco Bug IDs CSCvb40898.",
