    "description": "GNOME Nautilus before 3.23.90 allows attackers to spoof a file type by using the .desktop file extension, as demonstrated by an attack in which a .desktop files Name field ends in .pdf but this files Exec field launches a malicious sh -c command. In other words, Nautilus provides no UI indication that a file actually has the potentially unsafe .desktop extension instead, the UI only shows the .pdf extension. One (slightly) mitigating factor is that an attack requires the .desktop file to have execute permission. The solution is to ask the user to confirm that the file is supposed to be treated as a .desktop file, and then remember the users answer in the metadatatrusted field.",
