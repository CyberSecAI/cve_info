    "description": "HTTP/2 CONTINUATION DoS attack can cause Apache Traffic Server to consume more resources on the server. Version from 8.0.0 through 8.1.9, from 9.0.0 through 9.2.3 are affected. Users can set a new setting (proxy.config.http2.max_continuation_frames_per_minute) to limit the number of CONTINUATION frames per minute. ATS does have a fixed amount of memory a request can use and ATS adheres to these limits in previous releases. Users are recommended to upgrade to versions 8.1.10 or 9.2.4 which fixes the issue.",
