    "description": "Airflow versions 2.7.0 through 2.8.4 have a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to see sensitive provider configuration via the configuration UI page when non-sensitive-only was set as webserver.expose_config configuration (The celery provider is the only community provider currently that has sensitive configurations). You should migrate to Airflow 2.9 or change your expose_config configuration to False as a workaround. This is similar, but different to CVE-2023-46288 https//github.com/advisories/GHSA-9qqg-mh7c-chfq which concerned API, not UI configuration page.",
