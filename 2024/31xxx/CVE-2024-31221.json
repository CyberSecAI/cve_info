    "description": "Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Starting in version 0.10.0 and prior to version 0.23.0, after unpairing all devices in the web UI interface and then pairing only one device, all of the previously devices will be temporarily paired. Version 0.23.0 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, restarting Sunshine after unpairing all devices prevents the vulnerability.",
