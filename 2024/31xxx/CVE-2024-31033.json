    "description": "JJWT (aka Java JWT) through 0.12.5 ignores certain characters and thus a user might falsely conclude that they have a strong key. The impacted code is the setSigningKey() method within the DefaultJwtParser class and the signWith() method within the DefaultJwtBuilder class. NOTE the vendor disputes this because the ignores behavior cannot occur (in any version) unless there is a user error in how JJWT is used, and because the version that was actually tested must have been more than six years out of date.",
