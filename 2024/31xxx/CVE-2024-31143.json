    "description": "An optional feature of PCI MSI called Multiple Message allows a device to use multiple consecutive interrupt vectors. Unlike for MSI-X, the setting up of these consecutive vectors needs to happen all in one go. In this handling an error path could be taken in different situations, with or without a particular lock held. This error path wrongly releases the lock even when it is not currently held.",
