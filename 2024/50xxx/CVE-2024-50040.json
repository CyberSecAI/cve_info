    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved igb Do not bring the device up after non-fatal error Commit 004d25060c78 (igb Fix igb_down hung on surprise removal) changed igb_io_error_detected() to ignore non-fatal pcie errors in order to avoid hung task that can happen when igb_down() is called multiple times. This caused an issue when processing transient non-fatal errors. igb_io_resume(), which is called after igb_io_error_detected(), assumes that device is brought down by igb_io_error_detected() if the interface is up. This resulted in panic with stacktrace below.
