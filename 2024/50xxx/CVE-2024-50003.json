    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Fix system hang while resume with TBT monitor [Why] Connected with a Thunderbolt monitor and do the suspend and the system may hang while resume. The TBT monitor HPD will be triggered during the resume procedure and call the drm_client_modeset_probe() while struct drm_connector connector->dev->master is NULL. It will mess up the pipe topology after resume. [How] Skip the TBT monitor HPD during the resume procedure because we currently will probe the connectors after resume by default.
