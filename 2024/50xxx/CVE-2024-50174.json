    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/panthor Fix race when converting group handle to group object XArray provides its own internal lock which protects the internal array when entries are being simultaneously added and removed. However there is still a race between retrieving the pointer from the XArray and incrementing the reference count. To avoid this race simply hold the internal XArray lock when incrementing the reference count, this ensures there cannot be a racing call to xa_erase().",
