    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net hns3 fix kernel crash when uninstalling driver When the driver is uninstalled and the VF is disabled concurrently, a kernel crash occurs. The reason is that the two actions call function pci_disable_sriov(). The num_VFs is checked to determine whether to release the corresponding resources. During the second calling, num_VFs is not 0 and the resource release function is called. However, the corresponding resource has been released during the first invoking. Therefore, the problem occurs",
