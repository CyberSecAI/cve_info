    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vsock Update rx_bytes on read_skb() Make sure virtio_transport_inc_rx_pkt() and virtio_transport_dec_rx_pkt() calls are balanced (i.e. virtio_vsock_sockrx_bytes doesnt lie) after vsock_transportread_skb(). While here, also inform the peer that weve freed up space and it has more credit. Failing to update rx_bytes after packet is dequeued leads to a warning on SOCK_STREAM recv() [ 233.396654] rx_queue is empty, but rx_bytes is non-zero [ 233.396702] WARNING CPU 11 PID 40601 at net/vmw_vsock/virtio_transport_common.c589",
