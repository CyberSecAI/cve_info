    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved slip make slhc_remember() more robust against malicious packets syzbot found that slhc_remember() was missing checks against malicious packets [1]. slhc_remember() only checked the size of the packet was at least 20, which is not good enough. We need to make sure the packet includes the IPv4 and TCP header that are supposed to be carried. Add iph and th pointers to make the code more readable.
