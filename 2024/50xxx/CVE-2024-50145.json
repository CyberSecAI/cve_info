    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved octeon_ep Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx() build_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handle it inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference. __octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If skb allocation fails, keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue we shouldnt break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no associated skb in this case, dont process the packets and dont push them up the network stack - they are skipped. Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers used by the dropped packet. alloc_failures counter is incremented to mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
