    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Avoid overflow assignment in link_dp_cts sampling_rate is an uint8_t but is assigned an unsigned int, and thus it can overflow. As a result, sampling_rate is changed to uint32_t. Similarly, LINK_QUAL_PATTERN_SET has a size of 2 bits, and it should only be assigned to a value less or equal than 4. This fixes 2 INTEGER_OVERFLOW issues reported by Coverity.",
