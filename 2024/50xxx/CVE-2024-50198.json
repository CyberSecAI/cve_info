    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iio light veml6030 fix IIO device retrieval from embedded device The dev pointer that is received as an argument in the in_illuminance_period_available_show function references the device embedded in the IIO device, not in the i2c client. dev_to_iio_dev() must be used to accessthe right data. The current implementation leads to a segmentation fault on every attempt to read the attribute because indio_dev gets a NULL assignment. This bug has been present since the first appearance of the driver, apparently since the last version (V6) before getting applied. A constant attribute was used until then, and the last modifications might have not been tested again.",
