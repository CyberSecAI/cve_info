    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cxl/port Fix use-after-free, permit out-of-order decoder shutdown In support of investigating an initialization failure report [1], cxl_test was updated to register mock memory-devices after the mock root-port/bus device had been registered. That led to cxl_test crashing with a use-after-free bug with the following signature cxl_port_attach_region cxl region3 cxl_host_bridge.0port3 decoder3.0 add mem0decoder7.0 @ 0 next cxl_switch_uport.0 nr_eps 1 nr_targets 1 cxl_port_attach_region cxl region3 cxl_host_bridge.0port3 decoder3.0 add mem4decoder14.0 @ 1 next cxl_switch_uport.0 nr_eps 2 nr_targets 1 cxl_port_setup_targets cxl region3 cxl_switch_uport.0port6 target[0] = cxl_switch_dport.0 for mem0decoder7.0 @ 0 1) cxl_port_setup_targets cxl region3 cxl_switch_uport.0port6 target[1] = cxl_switch_dport.4 for mem4decoder14.0 @ 1 [..] cxld_unregister cxl decoder14.0 cxl_region_decode_reset cxl_region region3 mock_decoder_reset cxl_port port3 decoder3.0 reset 2) mock_decoder_reset cxl_port port3 decoder3.0 out of order reset, expected decoder3.1 cxl_endpoint_decoder_release cxl decoder14.0 [..] cxld_unregister cxl decoder7.0 3) cxl_region_decode_reset cxl_region region3 Oops general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0x6b6b6b6b6b6b6bc3 0000",
