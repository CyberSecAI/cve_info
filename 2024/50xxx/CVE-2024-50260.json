    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sock_map fix a NULL pointer dereference in sock_map_link_update_prog() The following race condition could trigger a NULL pointer dereference sock_map_link_detach() sock_map_link_update_prog() mutex_lock(&sockmap_mutex) ... sockmap_link->map = NULL mutex_unlock(&sockmap_mutex) mutex_lock(&sockmap_mutex) ... sock_map_prog_link_lookup(sockmap_link->map) mutex_unlock(&sockmap_mutex) Fix it by adding a NULL pointer check. In this specific case, it makes no sense to update a link which is being released.",
