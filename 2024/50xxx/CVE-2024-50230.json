    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nilfs2 fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only, __block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size, triggering a kernel bug. This was found to be because the checked flag of a page/folio was not cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2s own routine, which causes the sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory page/folio is reloaded. So, fix that. This was necessary when the use of nilfs2s own page discard routine was applied to more than just metadata files.",
