    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM nSVM Ignore nCR3[40] when loading PDPTEs from memory Ignore nCR3[40] when loading PDPTEs from memory for nested SVM, as bits 40 of CR3 are ignored when PAE paging is used, and thus VMRUN doesnt enforce 32-byte alignment of nCR3. In the absolute worst case scenario, failure to ignore bits 40 can result in an out-of-bounds read, e.g. if the target page is at the end of a memslot, and the VMM isnt using guard pages. Per the APM The CR3 register points to the base address of the page-directory-pointer table. The page-directory-pointer table is aligned on a 32-byte boundary, with the low 5 address bits 40 assumed to be 0. And the SDMs much more explicit 40 Ignored Note, KVM gets this right when loading PDPTRs, its only the nSVM flow that is broken.",
