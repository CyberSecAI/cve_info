  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved PCI Hold rescan lock while adding devices during host probe Since adding the PCI power control code, we may end up with a race between the pwrctl platform device rescanning the bus and host controller probe functions. The latter need to take the rescan lock when adding devices or we may end up in an undefined state having two incompletely added devices and hit the following crash when trying to remove the device over sysfs Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000 Internal error Oops 0000000096000004",
