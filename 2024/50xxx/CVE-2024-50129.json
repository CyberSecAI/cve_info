    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net pse-pd Fix out of bound for loop Adjust the loop limit to prevent out-of-bounds access when iterating over PI structures. The loop should not reach the index pcdev->nr_lines since we allocate exactly pcdev->nr_lines number of PI structures. This fix ensures proper bounds are maintained during iterations.",
