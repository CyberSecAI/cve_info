    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ALSA firewire-lib Avoid division by zero in apply_constraint_to_size() The step variable is initialized to zero. It is changed in the loop, but if its not changed it will remain zero. Add a variable check before the division. The observed behavior was introduced by commit 826b5de90c0b (ALSA firewire-lib fix insufficient PCM rule for period/buffer size), and it is difficult to show that any of the interval parameters will satisfy the snd_interval_test() condition with data from the amdtp_rate_table[] table. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
