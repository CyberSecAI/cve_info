    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net fec dont save PTP state if PTP is unsupported Some platforms (such as i.MX25 and i.MX27) do not support PTP, so on these platforms fec_ptp_init() is not called and the related members in fep are not initialized. However, fec_ptp_save_state() is called unconditionally, which causes the kernel to panic. Therefore, add a condition so that fec_ptp_save_state() is not called if PTP is not supported.",
