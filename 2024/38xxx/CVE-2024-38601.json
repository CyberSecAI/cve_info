    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ring-buffer Fix a race between readers and resize checks The reader code in rb_get_reader_page() swaps a new reader page into the ring buffer by doing cmpxchg on old->list.prev->next to point it to the new page. Following that, if the operation is successful, old->list.next->prev gets updated too. This means the underlying doubly-linked list is temporarily inconsistent, page->prev->next or page->next->prev might not be equal back to page for some page in the ring buffer. The resize operation in ring_buffer_resize() can be invoked in parallel. It calls rb_check_pages() which can detect the described inconsistency and stop further tracing [ 190.271762] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [ 190.271771] WARNING CPU 1 PID 6186 at kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c1467 rb_check_pages.isra.0+0x6a/0xa0 [ 190.271789] Modules linked in [...] [ 190.271991] Unloaded tainted modules intel_uncore_frequency(E)1 skx_edac(E)1 [ 190.272002] CPU 1 PID 6186 Comm cmd.sh Kdump loaded Tainted G E 6.9.0-rc6-default #5 158d3e1e6d0b091c34c3b96bfd99a1c58306d79f [ 190.272011] Hardware name QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552c-rebuilt.opensuse.org 04/01/2014 [ 190.272015] RIP 0010rb_check_pages.isra.0+0x6a/0xa0 [ 190.272023] Code [...] [ 190.272028] RSP 0018ffff9c37463abb70 EFLAGS 00010206 [ 190.272034] RAX ffff8eba04b6cb80 RBX 0000000000000007 RCX ffff8eba01f13d"
