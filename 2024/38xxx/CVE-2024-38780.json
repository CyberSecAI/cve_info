    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved dma-buf/sw-sync dont enable IRQ from sync_print_obj() Since commit a6aa8fca4d79 (dma-buf/sw-sync Reduce irqsave/irqrestore from known context) by error replaced spin_unlock_irqrestore() with spin_unlock_irq() for both sync_debugfs_show() and sync_print_obj() despite sync_print_obj() is called from sync_debugfs_show(), lockdep complains inconsistent lock state warning. Use plain spin_{lock,unlock}() for sync_print_obj(), for sync_debugfs_show() is already using spin_{lock,unlock}_irq().",
