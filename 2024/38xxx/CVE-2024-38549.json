    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/mediatek Add 0 size check to mtk_drm_gem_obj Add a check to mtk_drm_gem_init if we attempt to allocate a GEM object of 0 bytes. Currently, no such check exists and the kernel will panic if a userspace application attempts to allocate a 0x0 GBM buffer. Tested by attempting to allocate a 0x0 GBM buffer on an MT8188 and verifying that we now return EINVAL.",
