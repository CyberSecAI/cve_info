    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi brcmfmac pcie handle randbuf allocation failure The kzalloc() in brcmf_pcie_download_fw_nvram() will return null if the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we use get_random_bytes() to generate random bytes in the randbuf, the null pointer dereference bug will happen. In order to prevent allocation failure, this patch adds a separate function using buffer on kernel stack to generate random bytes in the randbuf, which could prevent the kernel stack from overflow.",
