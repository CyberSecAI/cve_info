    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi nl80211 Avoid address calculations via out of bounds array indexing Before request->channels[] can be used, request->n_channels must be set. Additionally, address calculations for memory after the channels array need to be calculated from the allocation base (request) rather than via the first out of bounds index of channels, otherwise run-time bounds checking will throw a warning.",
