    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net bridge xmit make sure we have at least eth header len bytes syzbot triggered an uninit value[1] error in bridge devices xmit path by sending a short (less than ETH_HLEN bytes) skb. To fix it check if we can actually pull that amount instead of assuming.
