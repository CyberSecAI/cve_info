    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved thermal/drivers/tsens Fix null pointer dereference compute_intercept_slope() is called from calibrate_8960() (in tsens-8960.c) as compute_intercept_slope(priv, p1, NULL, ONE_PT_CALIB) which lead to null pointer dereference (if DEBUG or DYNAMIC_DEBUG set). Fix this bug by adding null pointer check. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
