    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved block refine the EOF check in blkdev_iomap_begin blkdev_iomap_begin rounds down the offset to the logical block size before stashing it in iomap->offset and checking that it still is inside the inode size. Check the i_size check to the raw pos value so that we dont try a zero size write if iter->pos is unaligned.",
