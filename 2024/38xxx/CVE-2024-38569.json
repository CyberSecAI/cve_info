    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drivers/perf hisi_pcie Fix out-of-bound access when valid event group The perf tool allows users to create event groups through following cmd [1], but the driver does not check whether the array index is out of bounds when writing data to the event_group array. If the number of events in an event_group is greater than HISI_PCIE_MAX_COUNTERS, the memory write overflow of event_group array occurs. Add array index check to fix the possible array out of bounds violation, and return directly when write new events are written to array bounds. There are 9 different events in an event_group. [1] perf stat -e {pmu/event1/, ... ,pmu/event9/}",
