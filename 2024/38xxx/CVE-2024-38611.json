    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media i2c et8ek8 Dont strip remove function when driver is builtin Using __exit for the remove function results in the remove callback being discarded with CONFIG_VIDEO_ET8EK8=y. When such a device gets unbound (e.g. using sysfs or hotplug), the driver is just removed without the cleanup being performed. This results in resource leaks. Fix it by compiling in the remove callback unconditionally. This also fixes a W=1 modpost warning WARNING modpost drivers/media/i2c/et8ek8/et8ek8 section mismatch in reference et8ek8_i2c_driver+0x10 (section .data) -> et8ek8_remove (section .exit.text)",
