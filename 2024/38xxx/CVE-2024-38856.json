    "description": "Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache OFBiz. This issue affects Apache OFBiz through 18.12.14. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 18.12.15, which fixes the issue. Unauthenticated endpoints could allow execution of screen rendering code of screens if some preconditions are met (such as when the screen definitions dont explicitly check users permissions because they rely on the configuration of their endpoints).",
