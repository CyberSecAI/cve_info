    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drivers/perf hisi hns3 Actually use devm_add_action_or_reset() pci_alloc_irq_vectors() allocates an irq vector. When devm_add_action() fails, the irq vector is not freed, which leads to a memory leak. Replace the devm_add_action with devm_add_action_or_reset to ensure the irq vector can be destroyed when it fails.",
