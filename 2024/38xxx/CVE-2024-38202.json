  "description": "Summary Microsoft was notified that an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows Update, potentially enabling an attacker with basic user privileges to reintroduce previously mitigated vulnerabilities or circumvent some features of Virtualization Based Security (VBS). However, an attacker attempting to exploit this vulnerability requires additional interaction by a privileged user to be successful. Microsoft is developing a security update to mitigate this threat, but it is not yet available. Guidance to help customers reduce the risks associated with this vulnerability and to protect their systems until the mitigation is available in a Windows security update is provided in the Recommended Actions section of this CVE. This CVE will be updated, and customers will be notified when the official mitigation is available in a Windows security update. We highly encourage customers to subscribe to Security Update Guide notifications to receive an alert when this update occurs.
