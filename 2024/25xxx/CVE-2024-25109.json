    "description": "ManageWiki is a MediaWiki extension allowing users to manage wikis. SpecialManageWiki does not escape escape interface messages on the `columns` and `help` keys on the form descriptor. An attacker may exploit this and would have a cross site scripting attack vector. Exploiting this on-wiki requires the `(editinterface)` right. Users should apply the code changes in commits `886cc6b94`, `2ef0f50880`, and `6942e8b2c` to resolve this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
