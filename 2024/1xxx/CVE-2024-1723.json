This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Affected parameters include $instance[fonts][title_options][tag], $headline_tag, $sub_headline_tag, $feature[icon].",
