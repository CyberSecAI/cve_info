  "description": "During the secure boot, bl2 (the second stage of the bootloader) loops over images defined in the table bl2_mem_params_descs. For each image, the bl2 reads the image length and destination from the images certificate. Because of the way of reading from the image, which base on 32-bit unsigned integer value, it can result to an integer overflow. An attacker can bypass memory range restriction and write data out of buffer bounds, which could result in bypass of secure boot.
