This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE This vulnerability is only exploitable on web servers running NGINX. It is not exploitable on web servers running Apache HTTP Server.",
