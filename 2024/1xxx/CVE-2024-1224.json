    "description": "This vulnerability exists in USB Pratirodh due to the usage of a weaker cryptographic algorithm (hash) SHA1 in user login component. A local attacker with administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability to obtain the password of USB Pratirodh on the targeted system. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to take control of the application and modify the access control of registered users or devices on the targeted system.",
