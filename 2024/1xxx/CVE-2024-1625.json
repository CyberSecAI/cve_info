    "description": "An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application version 0.3.0, allowing unauthorized deletion of any organizations project. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks in the project deletion endpoint, where the endpoint fails to verify if the project ID provided in the request belongs to the requesting users organization. As a result, an attacker can delete projects belonging to any organization by sending a crafted DELETE request with the target projects ID. This issue affects the project deletion functionality implemented in the projects.delete route.",
