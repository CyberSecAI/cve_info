    "description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.9.2, allowing attackers to access arbitrary files on the server. By crafting a series of HTTP POST requests with specially crafted artifact_location and source parameters, using a local URI with # instead of ?, an attacker can traverse the servers directory structure. The issue occurs due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the servers handlers.",
