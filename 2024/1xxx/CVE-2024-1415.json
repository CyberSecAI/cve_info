    "description": "The Responsive Contact Form Builder & Lead Generation Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. These actions may result in form deletion, and lead signup as well as file upload.",
