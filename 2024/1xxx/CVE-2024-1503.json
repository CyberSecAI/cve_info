    "description": "The Tutor LMS - eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the erase_tutor_data() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to deactivate the plugin and erase all data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This requires the Erase upon uninstallation option to be enabled.",
