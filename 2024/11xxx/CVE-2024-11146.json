    "description": "TrueFiling is a collaborative, web-based electronic filing system where attorneys, paralegals, court reporters and self-represented filers collect public legal documentation into cases. TrueFiling is an entirely cloud-hosted application. Prior to version 3.1.112.19, TrueFiling trusted some client-controlled identifiers passed in URL requests to retrieve information. Platform users must self-register for an account, and once authenticated, could manipulate those identifiers to gain partial access to case information and the ability to partially change user access to case information. This vulnerability was addressed in version 3.1.112.19 and all instances were updated by 2024-11-08.",
