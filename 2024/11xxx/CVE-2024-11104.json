  "description": "The Sky Addons for Elementor (Free Templates Library, Live Copy, Animations, Post Grid, Post Carousel, Particles, Sliders, Chart, Blogs) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of service due to a missing capability check on the save_options() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. Please note this is limited to option values that can be saved as arrays.",
