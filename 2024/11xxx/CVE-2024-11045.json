    "description": "A Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability in automatic1111/stable-diffusion-webui version 1.10.0 allows an attacker to clone a malicious server extension from a GitHub repository. The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper validation on WebSocket connections at ws//127.0.0.17860/queue/join, enabling unauthorized actions on the server. This can lead to unauthorized cloning of server extensions, execution of malicious scripts, data exfiltration, and potential denial of service (DoS).",
