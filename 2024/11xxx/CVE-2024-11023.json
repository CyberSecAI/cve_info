    "description": "Firebase JavaScript SDK utilizes a FIREBASE_DEFAULTS cookie to store configuration data, including an _authTokenSyncURL field used for session synchronization. If this cookie field is preset via an attacker by any other method, the attacker can manipulate the _authTokenSyncURL to point to their own server and it would allow an actor to capture user session data transmitted by the SDK. We recommend upgrading Firebase JS SDK at least to 10.9.0.",
