    "description": "A vulnerability in significant-gravitas/autogpt version 0.5.1 allows an attacker to bypass the shell commands denylist settings. The issue arises when the denylist is configured to block specific commands, such as whoami and /bin/whoami. An attacker can circumvent this restriction by executing commands with a modified path, such as /bin/./whoami, which is not recognized by the denylist.",
