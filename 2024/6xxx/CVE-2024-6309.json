    "description": "The Attachment File Icons (AF Icons) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 1.3. This is due to missing nonce validation in the afi_overview function and missing file type validation in the upload_icons function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
