  "description": "A vulnerability in parisneo/lollms-webui version 9.8 allows for a Denial of Service (DOS) attack when uploading an audio file. If an attacker appends a large number of characters to the end of a multipart boundary, the system will continuously process each character, rendering lollms-webui inaccessible. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, enabling remote exploitation. The vulnerability leads to service disruption, resource exhaustion, and extended downtime.",
