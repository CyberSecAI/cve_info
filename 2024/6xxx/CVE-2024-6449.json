    "description": "HyperView Geoportal Toolkit in versions lower than 8.5.0 does not restrict cross-domain requests when fetching remote content pointed by one of GET request parameters. An unauthenticated remote attacker can prepare links, which upon opening will load scripts from a remote location controlled by the attacker and execute them in the user space. By manipulating this parameter it is also possible to enumerate some of the devices in Local Area Network in which the server resides.",
