    "description": "The IQ Testimonials plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the process_image_upload function in versions up to, and including, 2.2.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. This can only be exploited if the gd php extension is not loaded on the server.",
