    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i3c mipi-i3c-hci Mask ring interrupts before ring stop request Bus cleanup path in DMA mode may trigger a RING_OP_STAT interrupt when the ring is being stopped. Depending on timing between ring stop request completion, interrupt handler removal and code execution this may lead to a NULL pointer dereference in hci_dma_irq_handler() if it gets to run after the io_data pointer is set to NULL in hci_dma_cleanup(). Prevent this my masking the ring interrupts before ring stop request.",
