    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/msm/dpu move dpu_encoders connector assignment to atomic_enable() For cases where the crtcs connectors_changed was set without enable/active getting toggled , there is an atomic_enable() call followed by an atomic_disable() but without an atomic_mode_set(). This results in a NULL ptr access for the dpu_encoder_get_drm_fmt() call in the atomic_enable() as the dpu_encoders connector was cleared in the atomic_disable() but not re-assigned as there was no atomic_mode_set() call. Fix the NULL ptr access by moving the assignment for atomic_enable() and also use drm_atomic_get_new_connector_for_encoder() to get the connector from the atomic_state.
