  "description": "A flaw was found in the HFS filesystem. When reading an HFS volumes name at grub_fs_mount(), the HFS filesystem driver performs a strcpy() using the user-provided volume name as input without properly validating the volume names length. This issue may read to a heap-based out-of-bounds writer, impacting grubs sensitive data integrity and eventually leading to a secure boot protection bypass.",
