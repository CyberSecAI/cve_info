  "description": "When reading the language .mo file in grub_mofile_open(), grub2 fails to verify an integer overflow when allocating its internal buffer. A crafted .mo file may lead the buffer size calculation to overflow, leading to out-of-bound reads and writes. This flaw allows an attacker to leak sensitive data or overwrite critical data, possibly circumventing secure boot protections.",
