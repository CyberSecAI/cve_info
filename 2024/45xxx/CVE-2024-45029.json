    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i2c tegra Do not mark ACPI devices as irq safe On ACPI machines, the tegra i2c module encounters an issue due to a mutex being called inside a spinlock. This leads to the following bug BUG sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c585 ... Call trace __might_sleep __mutex_lock_common mutex_lock_nested acpi_subsys_runtime_resume rpm_resume tegra_i2c_xfer The problem arises because during __pm_runtime_resume(), the spinlock &dev->power.lock is acquired before rpm_resume() is called. Later, rpm_resume() invokes acpi_subsys_runtime_resume(), which relies on mutexes, triggering the error. To address this issue, devices on ACPI are now marked as not IRQ-safe, considering the dependency of acpi_subsys_runtime_resume() on mutexes.",
