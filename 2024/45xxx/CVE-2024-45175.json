  "description": "An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401. Sensitive information is stored in cleartext. It was found out that sensitive information, for example login credentials of cameras, is stored in cleartext. Thus, an attacker with filesystem access, for example exploiting a path traversal attack, has access to the login data of all configured cameras, or the configured FTP server.",
