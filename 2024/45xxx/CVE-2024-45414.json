    "description": "The HTTPD binary in multiple ZTE routers has a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in webPrivateDecrypt function. This function is responsible for decrypting RSA encrypted ciphertext, the encrypted data is supplied base64 encoded. The decoded ciphertext is stored on the stack without checking its length. An unauthenticated attacker can get RCE as root by exploiting this vulnerability.",
