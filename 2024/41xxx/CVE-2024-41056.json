    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved firmware cs_dsp Use strnlen() on name fields in V1 wmfw files Use strnlen() instead of strlen() on the algorithm and coefficient name string arrays in V1 wmfw files. In V1 wmfw files the name is a NUL-terminated string in a fixed-size array. cs_dsp should protect against overrunning the array if the NUL terminator is missing.",
