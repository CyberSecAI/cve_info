    "description": "JupyterHub is software that allows one to create a multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks. Prior to versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0, if a user is granted the `adminusers` scope, they may escalate their own privileges by making themselves a full admin user. The impact is relatively small in that `adminusers` is already an extremely privileged scope only granted to trusted users. In effect, `adminusers` is equivalent to `admin=True`, which is not intended. Note that the change here only prevents escalation to the built-in JupyterHub admin role that has unrestricted permissions. It does not prevent users with e.g. `groups` permissions from granting themselves or other users permissions via group membership, which is intentional. Versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0 fix this issue.",
