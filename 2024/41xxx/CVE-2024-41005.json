    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netpoll Fix race condition in netpoll_owner_active KCSAN detected a race condition in netpoll BUG KCSAN data-race in net_rx_action / netpoll_send_skb write (marked) to 0xffff8881164168b0 of 4 bytes by interrupt on cpu 10 net_rx_action (./include/linux/netpoll.h90 net/core/dev.c6712 net/core/dev.c6822) read to 0xffff8881164168b0 of 4 bytes by task 1 on cpu 2 netpoll_send_skb (net/core/netpoll.c319 net/core/netpoll.c345 net/core/netpoll.c393) netpoll_send_udp (net/core/netpoll.c?) value changed 0x0000000a -> 0xffffffff This happens because netpoll_owner_active() needs to check if the current CPU is the owner of the lock, touching napi->poll_owner non atomically. The ->poll_owner field contains the current CPU holding the lock. Use an atomic read to check if the poll owner is the current CPU.",
