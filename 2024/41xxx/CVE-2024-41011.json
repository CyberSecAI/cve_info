    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amdkfd dont allow mapping the MMIO HDP page with large pages We dont get the right offset in that case. The GPU has an unused 4K area of the register BAR space into which you can remap registers. We remap the HDP flush registers into this space to allow userspace (CPU or GPU) to flush the HDP when it updates VRAM. However, on systems with >4K pages, we end up exposing PAGE_SIZE of MMIO space.",
