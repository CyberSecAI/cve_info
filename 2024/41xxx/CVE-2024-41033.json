    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cachestat do not flush stats in recency check syzbot detects that cachestat() is flushing stats, which can sleep, in its RCU read section (see [1]). This is done in the workingset_test_recent() step (which checks if the folios eviction is recent). Move the stat flushing step to before the RCU read section of cachestat, and skip stat flushing during the recency check. [1] https//lore.kernel.org/cgroups/000000000000f71227061bdf97e0@google.com/",
