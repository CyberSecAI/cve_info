    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tracing Build event generation tests only as modules The kprobes and synth event generation test modules add events and lock (get a reference) those event file reference in module init function, and unlock and delete it in module exit function. This is because those are designed for playing as modules. If we make those modules as built-in, those events are left locked in the kernel, and never be removed. This causes kprobe event self-test failure as below.
