    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC SOF Intel hda fix null deref on system suspend entry When system enters suspend with an active stream, SOF core calls hw_params_upon_resume(). On Intel platforms with HDA DMA used to manage the link DMA, this leads to call chain of hda_dsp_set_hw_params_upon_resume() -> hda_dsp_dais_suspend() -> hda_dai_suspend() -> hda_ipc4_post_trigger() A bug is hit in hda_dai_suspend() as hda_link_dma_cleanup() is run first, which clears hext_stream->link_substream, and then hda_ipc4_post_trigger() is called with a NULL snd_pcm_substream pointer.",
