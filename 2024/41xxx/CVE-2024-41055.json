    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm prevent derefencing NULL ptr in pfn_section_valid() Commit 5ec8e8ea8b77 (mm/sparsemem fix race in accessing memory_section->usage) changed pfn_section_valid() to add a READ_ONCE() call around ms->usage to fix a race with section_deactivate() where ms->usage can be cleared. The READ_ONCE() call, by itself, is not enough to prevent NULL pointer dereference. We need to check its value before dereferencing it.",
