    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tun add missing verification for short frame The cited commit missed to check against the validity of the frame length in the tun_xdp_one() path, which could cause a corrupted skb to be sent downstack. Even before the skb is transmitted, the tun_xdp_one-->eth_type_trans() may access the Ethernet header although it can be less than ETH_HLEN. Once transmitted, this could either cause out-of-bound access beyond the actual length, or confuse the underlayer with incorrect or inconsistent header length in the skb metadata. In the alternative path, tun_get_user() already prohibits short frame which has the length less than Ethernet header size from being transmitted for IFF_TAP. This is to drop any frame shorter than the Ethernet header size just like how tun_get_user() does. CVE CVE-2024-41091",
