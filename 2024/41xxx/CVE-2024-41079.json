    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nvmet always initialize cqe.result The spec doesnt mandate that the first two double words (aka results) for the command queue entry need to be set to 0 when they are not used (not specified). Though, the target implemention returns 0 for TCP and FC but not for RDMA. Lets make RDMA behave the same and thus explicitly initializing the result field. This prevents leaking any data from the stack.",
