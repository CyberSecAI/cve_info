    "description": "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. There is an error in the stack management when compiling the `IR` for `sha3_64`. Concretely, the `height` variable is miscalculated. The vulnerability cant be triggered without writing the `IR` by hand (that is, it cannot be triggered from regular vyper code). `sha3_64` is used for retrieval in mappings. No flow that would cache the `key` was found so the issue shouldnt be possible to trigger when compiling the compiler-generated `IR`. This issue isnt triggered during normal compilation of vyper code so the impact is low. At the time of publication there is no patch available.",
