    "description": "The memory allocation function ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED does not guarantee a successful allocation, but the subsequent code directly dereferences the pointer that receives it, which may lead to null pointer dereference. To fix this issue, a null pointer check should be added. If it is null, return exception code AE_NO_MEMORY.",
