    "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Expressway Edge (Expressway-E) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to masquerade as another user on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to inadequate authorization checks for Mobile and Remote Access (MRA) users. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a series of crafted commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to intercept calls that are destined for a particular phone number or to make phone calls and have that phone number appear on the caller ID. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be an MRA user on an affected system.",
