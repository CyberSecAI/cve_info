    "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have a valid account on the device that is configured with a custom read-only role. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of role permissions in part of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a write operation on the affected part of the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify certain parts of the configuration.",
