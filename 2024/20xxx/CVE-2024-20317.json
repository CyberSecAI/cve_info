    "description": "A vulnerability in the handling of specific Ethernet frames by Cisco IOS XR Software for various Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) platforms could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause critical priority packets to be dropped, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to incorrect classification of certain types of Ethernet frames that are received on an interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific types of Ethernet frames to or through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause control plane protocol relationships to fail, resulting in a DoS condition. For more information, see the section of this advisory. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
