  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform an SQL injection attack against an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have a valid account on the device with the role of Security Approver, Intrusion Admin, Access Admin, or Network Admin. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read the contents of databases on the affected device and also obtain limited read access to the underlying operating system.",
