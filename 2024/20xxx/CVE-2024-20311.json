This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of LISP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LISP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note This vulnerability could be exploited over either IPv4 or IPv6 transport.",
