    "description": "A vulnerability in the REST API endpoints of Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to perform limited Administrator actions on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization controls on some REST API endpoints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform limited Administrator functions such as viewing portions of the web UI, generating config only or full backup files, and deleting tech support files. This vulnerability only affects a subset of REST API endpoints and does not affect the web-based management interface.",
