    "description": "A vulnerability in the SSH server of Cisco Catalyst Center, formerly Cisco DNA Center, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impersonate a Cisco Catalyst Center appliance. This vulnerability is due to the presence of a static SSH host key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a machine-in-the-middle attack on SSH connections, which could allow the attacker to intercept traffic between SSH clients and a Cisco Catalyst Center appliance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate the affected appliance, inject commands into the terminal session, and steal valid user credentials.",
