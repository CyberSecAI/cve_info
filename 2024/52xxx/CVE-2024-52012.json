  "description": "Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Solr. Solr instances running on Windows are vulnerable to arbitrary filepath write-access, due to a lack of input-sanitation in the configset upload API. Commonly known as a zipslip, maliciously constructed ZIP files can use relative filepaths to write data to unanticipated parts of the filesystem. This issue affects Apache Solr from 6.6 through 9.7.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.8.0, which fixes the issue. Users unable to upgrade may also safely prevent the issue by using Solrs Rule-Based Authentication Plugin to restrict access to the configset upload API, so that it can only be accessed by a trusted set of administrators/users.",
