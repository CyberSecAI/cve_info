    "description": "Argo Helm is a collection of community maintained charts for `argoproj.github.io` projects. Prior to version 0.45.0, the `workflow-role`) lacks granularity in its privileges, giving permissions to `workflowtasksets` and `workflowartifactgctasks` to all workflow Pods, when only certain types of Pods created by the Controller require these privileges. The impact is minimal, as an attack could only affect status reporting for certain types of Pods and templates. Version 0.45.0 fixes the issue.",
