    "description": "The Pedalo Connector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.0.5. This is due to insufficient restriction on the login_admin_user function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log to the first user, who is usually the administrator, or if it does not exist, then to the first administrator.",
