    "description": "A vulnerability exists in NSD570 login panel that does not restrict excessive authentication attempts. If exploited, this could cause account takeover and unauthorized access to the system when an attacker conducts brute-force attacks against the equipment login. Note that the system supports only one concurrent session and implements a delay of more than a second between failed login attempts making it difficult to automate the attacks.",
