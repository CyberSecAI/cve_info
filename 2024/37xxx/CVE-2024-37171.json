    "description": "SAP Transportation Management (Collaboration Portal) allows an attacker with non-administrative privileges to send a crafted request from a vulnerable web application. This will trigger the application handler to send a request to an unintended service, which may reveal information about that service. The information obtained could be used to target internal systems behind firewalls that are normally inaccessible to an attacker from the external network, resulting in a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability. There is no effect on integrity or availability of the application.",
