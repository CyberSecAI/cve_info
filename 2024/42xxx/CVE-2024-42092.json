    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved gpio davinci Validate the obtained number of IRQs Value of pdata->gpio_unbanked is taken from Device Tree. In case of broken DT due to any error this value can be any. Without this value validation there can be out of chips->irqs array boundaries access in davinci_gpio_probe(). Validate the obtained nirq value so that it wont exceed the maximum number of IRQs per bank. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
