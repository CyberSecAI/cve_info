    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cachefiles add missing lock protection when polling Add missing lock protection in poll routine when iterating xarray, otherwise Even with RCU read lock held, only the slot of the radix tree is ensured to be pinned there, while the data structure (e.g. struct cachefiles_req) stored in the slot has no such guarantee. The poll routine will iterate the radix tree and dereference cachefiles_req accordingly. Thus RCU read lock is not adequate in this case and spinlock is needed here.",
