    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net txgbe free isb resources at the right time When using MSI/INTx interrupt, the shared interrupts are still being handled in the device remove routine, before free IRQs. So isb memory is still read after it is freed. Thus move wx_free_isb_resources() from txgbe_close() to txgbe_remove(). And fix the improper isb free action in txgbe_open() error handling path.",
