    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm huge_memory use !CONFIG_64BIT to relax huge page alignment on 32 bit machines Yves-Alexis Perez reported commit 4ef9ad19e176 (mm huge_memory dont force huge page alignment on 32 bit) didnt work for x86_32 [1]. It is because x86_32 uses CONFIG_X86_32 instead of CONFIG_32BIT. !CONFIG_64BIT should cover all 32 bit machines.
