    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/iucv Avoid explicit cpumask var allocation on stack For CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK=y kernel, explicit allocation of cpumask variable on stack is not recommended since it can cause potential stack overflow. Instead, kernel code should always use *cpumask_var API(s) to allocate cpumask var in config-neutral way, leaving allocation strategy to CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK. Use *cpumask_var API(s) to address it.",
