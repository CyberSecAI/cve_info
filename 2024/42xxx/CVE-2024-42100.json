    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved clk sunxi-ng common Dont call hw_to_ccu_common on hw without common In order to set the rate range of a hw sunxi_ccu_probe calls hw_to_ccu_common() assuming all entries in desc->ccu_clks are contained in a ccu_common struct. This assumption is incorrect and, in consequence, causes invalid pointer de-references. Remove the faulty call. Instead, add one more loop that iterates over the ccu_clks and sets the rate range, if required.",
