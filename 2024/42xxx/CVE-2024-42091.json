    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe Check pat.ops before dumping PAT settings We may leave pat.ops unset when running on brand new platform or when running as a VF. While the former is unlikely, the latter is valid (future) use case and will cause NPD when someone will try to dump PAT settings by debugfs. Its better to check pointer to pat.ops instead of specific .dump hook, as we have this hook always defined for every .ops variant.",
