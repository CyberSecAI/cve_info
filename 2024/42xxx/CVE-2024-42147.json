    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved crypto hisilicon/debugfs - Fix debugfs uninit process issue During the zip probe process, the debugfs failure does not stop the probe. When debugfs initialization fails, jumping to the error branch will also release regs, in addition to its own rollback operation. As a result, it may be released repeatedly during the regs uninit process. Therefore, the null check needs to be added to the regs uninit process.",
