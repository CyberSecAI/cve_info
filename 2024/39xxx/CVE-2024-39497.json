    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/shmem-helper Fix BUG_ON() on mmap(PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE) Lack of check for copy-on-write (COW) mapping in drm_gem_shmem_mmap allows users to call mmap with PROT_WRITE and MAP_PRIVATE flag causing a kernel panic due to BUG_ON in vmf_insert_pfn_prot BUG_ON((vma->vm_flags & VM_PFNMAP) && is_cow_mapping(vma->vm_flags)) Return -EINVAL early if COW mapping is detected. This bug affects all drm drivers using default shmem helpers. It can be reproduced by this simple example void *ptr = mmap(0, size, PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, mmap_offset) ptr[0] = 0",
