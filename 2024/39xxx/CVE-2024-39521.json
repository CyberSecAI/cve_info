    "description": "An Improper Neutralization of Special Elements vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved commands allows a local, authenticated attacker with low privileges to escalate their privileges to root leading to a full compromise of the system. The Junos OS Evolved CLI doesnt properly handle command options in some cases, allowing users which execute specific CLI commands with a crafted set of parameters to escalate their privileges to root on shell level. This issue affects Junos OS Evolved * 21.1-EVO versions 21.1R1-EVO and later before 21.2R3-S8-EVO, * 21.4-EVO versions before 21.4R3-S7-EVO, * 22.1-EVO versions before 22.1R3-S6-EVO, * 22.2-EVO versions before 22.2R3-EVO, * 22.3-EVO versions before 22.3R2-EVO.",
