    "description": "Red is a fully modular Discord bot. Due to a bug in Reds Core API, 3rd-party cogs using the `@commands.can_manage_channel()` command permission check without additional permission controls may authorize a user to run a command even when that user doesnt have permissions to manage a channel. None of the core commands or core cogs are affected. The maintainers of the project are not aware of any _public_ 3rd-party cog utilizing this API at the time of writing this advisory. The problem was patched and released in version 3.5.10.",
