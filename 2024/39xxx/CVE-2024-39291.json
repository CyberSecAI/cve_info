  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amdgpu Fix buffer size in gfx_v9_4_3_init_ cp_compute_microcode() and rlc_microcode() The function gfx_v9_4_3_init_microcode in gfx_v9_4_3.c was generating about potential truncation of output when using the snprintf function. The issue was due to the size of the buffer ucode_prefix being too small to accommodate the maximum possible length of the string being written into it. The string being written is amdgpu/%s_mec.bin or amdgpu/%s_rlc.bin, where %s is replaced by the value of chip_name. The length of this string without the %s is 16 characters. The warning message indicated that chip_name could be up to 29 characters long, resulting in a total of 45 characters, which exceeds the buffer size of 30 characters. To resolve this issue, the size of the ucode_prefix buffer has been reduced from 30 to 15. This ensures that the maximum possible length of the string being written into the buffer will not exceed its size, thus preventing potential buffer overflow and truncation issues. Fixes the below with gcc W=1 drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_4_3.c In function gfx_v9_4_3_early_init drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_4_3.c37952 warning %s directive output may be truncated writing up to 29 bytes into a region of size 23 [-Wformat-truncation=] 379 | snprintf(fw_name, sizeof(fw_name), amdgpu/%s_rlc.bin, chip_name) | ^~",
