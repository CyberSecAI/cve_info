    "description": "This is a similar, but different vulnerability than the issue reported as CVE-2024-39549. A double-free vulnerability in the routing process daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker to send a malformed BGP Path attribute update which allocates memory used to log the bad path attribute. This double free of memory is causing an rpd crash, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This issue affects Junos OS * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S4. Junos OS Evolved * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S4-EVO.",
