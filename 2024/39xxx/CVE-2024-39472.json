    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved xfs fix log recovery buffer allocation for the legacy h_size fixup Commit a70f9fe52daa (xfs detect and handle invalid iclog size set by mkfs) added a fixup for incorrect h_size values used for the initial umount record in old xfsprogs versions. Later commit 0c771b99d6c9 (xfs clean up calculation of LR header blocks) cleaned up the log reover buffer calculation, but stoped using the fixed up h_size value to size the log recovery buffer, which can lead to an out of bounds access when the incorrect h_size does not come from the old mkfs tool, but a fuzzer. Fix this by open coding xlog_logrec_hblks and taking the fixed h_size into account for this calculation.",
