    "description": "An SQL Injection vulnerability in Apache Superset exists due to improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands. Specifically, certain engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Supersets SQL authorization. To mitigate this, a new configuration key named DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS has been introduced. This key disallows the use of the following PostgreSQL functions version, query_to_xml, inet_server_addr, and inet_client_addr. Additional functions can be added to this list for increased protection. This issue affects Apache Superset before 4.0.2. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.2, which fixes the issue.",
