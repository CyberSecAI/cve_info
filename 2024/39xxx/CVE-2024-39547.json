    "description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the rpd-server of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved within cRPD allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker sending crafted TCP traffic to the routing engine (RE) to cause a CPU-based Denial of Service (DoS). If specially crafted TCP traffic is received by the control plane, or a TCP session terminates unexpectedly, it will cause increased control plane CPU utilization by the rpd-server process. While not explicitly required, the impact is more severe when RIB sharding is enabled.
