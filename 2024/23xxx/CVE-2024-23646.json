    "description": "Pimcores Admin Classic Bundle provides a backend user interface for Pimcore. The application allows users to create zip files from available files on the site. In the 1.x branch prior to version 1.3.2, parameter `selectedIds` is susceptible to SQL Injection. Any backend user with very basic permissions can execute arbitrary SQL statements and thus alter any data or escalate their privileges to at least admin level. Version 1.3.2 contains a fix for this issue.",
