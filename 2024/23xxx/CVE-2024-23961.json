  "description": "Alpine Halo9 UPDM_wemCmdUpdFSpeDecomp Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Alpine Halo9 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the UPDM_wemCmdUpdFSpeDecomp function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-23306",
