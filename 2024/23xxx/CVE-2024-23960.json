    "description": "Alpine Halo9 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to bypass signature validation mechanism on affected installations of Alpine Halo9 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the firmware metadata signature validation mechanism. The issue results from the lack of proper verification of a cryptographic signature. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-23102",
