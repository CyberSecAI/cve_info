  "description": "tls-listener is a rust lang wrapper around a connection listener to support TLS. With the default configuration of tls-listener, a malicious user can open 6.4 `TcpStream`s a second, sending 0 bytes, and can trigger a DoS. The default configuration options make any public service using `TlsListenernew()` vulnerable to a slow-loris DoS attack. This impacts any publicly accessible service using the default configuration of tls-listener in versions prior to 0.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this by passing a large value, such as `usizeMAX` as the parameter to `Buildermax_handshakes`.",
