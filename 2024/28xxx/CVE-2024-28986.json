    "description": "SolarWinds Web Help Desk was found to be susceptible to a Java Deserialization Remote Code Execution vulnerability that, if exploited, would allow an attacker to run commands on the host machine. \n\nWhile it was reported as an unauthenticated\u00a0vulnerability, SolarWinds has been unable to reproduce it\u00a0without authentication\u00a0after thorough testing. \u00a0\n\nHowever, out of an abundance of caution, we recommend all Web Help Desk customers apply the patch, which is now available.",
