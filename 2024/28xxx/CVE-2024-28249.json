Prior to versions 1.13.13, 1.14.8, and 1.15.2, in Cilium clusters with IPsec enabled and traffic matching Layer 7 policies, IPsec-eligible traffic between a nodes Envoy proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted and IPsec-eligible traffic between a nodes DNS proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted.
