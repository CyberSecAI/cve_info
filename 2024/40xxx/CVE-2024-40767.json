    "description": "In OpenStack Nova before 27.4.1, 28 before 28.2.1, and 29 before 29.1.1, by supplying a raw format image that is actually a crafted QCOW2 image with a backing file path or VMDK flat image with a descriptor file path, an authenticated user may convince systems to return a copy of the referenced files contents from the server, resulting in unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data. All Nova deployments are affected. NOTE this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-47951 and CVE-2024-32498.",
