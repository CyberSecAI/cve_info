    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mptcp ensure snd_una is properly initialized on connect This is strictly related to commit fb7a0d334894 (mptcp ensure snd_nxt is properly initialized on connect). It turns out that syzkaller can trigger the retransmit after fallback and before processing any other incoming packet - so that snd_una is still left uninitialized. Address the issue explicitly initializing snd_una together with snd_nxt and write_seq.",
