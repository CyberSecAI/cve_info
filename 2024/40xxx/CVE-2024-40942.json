    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi mac80211 mesh Fix leak of mesh_preq_queue objects The hwmp code use objects of type mesh_preq_queue, added to a list in ieee80211_if_mesh, to keep track of mpath we need to resolve. If the mpath gets deleted, ex mesh interface is removed, the entries in that list will never get cleaned. Fix this by flushing all corresponding items of the preq_queue in mesh_path_flush_pending(). This should take care of KASAN reports like this unreferenced object 0xffff00000668d800 (size 128) comm kworker/u84, pid 67, jiffies 4295419552 (age 1836.444s) hex dump (first 32 bytes) 00 1f 05 09 00 00 ff ff 00 d5 68 06 00 00 ff ff ..........h..... 8e 97 ea eb 3e b8 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ....>........... backtrace [] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x1e0/0x35c [] kmalloc_trace+0x34/0x80 [] mesh_queue_preq+0x44/0x2a8 [] mesh_nexthop_resolve+0x198/0x19c [] ieee80211_xmit+0x1d0/0x1f4 [] __ieee80211_subif_start_xmit+0x30c/0x764 [] ieee80211_subif_start_xmit+0x9c/0x7a4 [] dev_hard_start_xmit+0x174/0x440 [] __dev_queue_xmit+0xe24/0x111c [] batadv_send_skb_packet+0x180/0x1e4 [] batadv_v_elp_periodic_work+0x2f4/0x508 [] process_one_work+0x4b8/0xa1c"
