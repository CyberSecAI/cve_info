This could happen when * new (say invalid) source caps are advertised * the existing source caps are unregistered * tcpm_register_source_caps() returns with an error as usb_power_delivery_register_capabilities() fails This causes port->partner_source_caps to hold on to the now freed source caps. Reset port->partner_source_caps value to NULL after unregistering existing source caps.",
