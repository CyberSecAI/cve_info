    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/rxe Fix responder length checking for UD request packets According to the IBA specification If a UD request packet is detected with an invalid length, the request shall be an invalid request and it shall be silently dropped by the responder. The responder then waits for a new request packet. commit 689c5421bfe0 (RDMA/rxe Fix incorrect responder length checking) defers responder length check for UD QPs in function `copy_data`. But it introduces a regression issue for UD QPs. When the packet size is too large to fit in the receive buffer. `copy_data` will return error code -EINVAL. Then `send_data_in` will return RESPST_ERR_MALFORMED_WQE. UD QP will transfer into ERROR state.",
