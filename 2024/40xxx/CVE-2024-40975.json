    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved platform/x86 x86-android-tablets Unregister devices in reverse order Not all subsystems support a device getting removed while there are still consumers of the device with a reference to the device. One example of this is the regulator subsystem. If a regulator gets unregistered while there are still drivers holding a reference a WARN() at drivers/regulator/core.c5829 triggers, e.g. WARNING CPU 1 PID 1587 at drivers/regulator/core.c5829 regulator_unregister Hardware name Intel Corp.

On the 830 (8) and 1050 (10) models this regulator is controlled by a platform_device and x86_android_tablet_remove() removes platform_device-s before i2c_clients so the consumer gets removed first. But on the 1380 (13) model there is a lc824206xa micro-USB switch connected over I2C and the extcon driver for that controls the regulator. The bq24190 i2c-c",
