    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved dmaengine idxd Fix possible Use-After-Free in irq_process_work_list Use list_for_each_entry_safe() to allow iterating through the list and deleting the entry in the iteration process. The descriptor is freed via idxd_desc_complete() and theres a slight chance may cause issue for the list iterator when the descriptor is reused by another thread without it being deleted from the list.",
