    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tty add the option to have a tty reject a new ldisc ... and use it to limit the virtual terminals to just N_TTY. They are kind of special, and in particular, the con_write() routine violates the writes cannot sleep rule that some ldiscs rely on. This avoids the BUG sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/printk/printk.c2659 when N_GSM has been attached to a virtual console, and gsmld_write() calls con_write() while holding a spinlock, and con_write() then tries to get the console lock.",
