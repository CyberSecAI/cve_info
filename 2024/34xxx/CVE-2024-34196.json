  "description": "Totolink AC1200 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router A3002RU_V3 Firmware V3.0.0-B20230809.1615 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. The boa program allows attackers to modify the value of the vwlan_idx field via formMultiAP. This can lead to a stack overflow through the formWlEncrypt CGI function by constructing malicious HTTP requests and passing a WLAN SSID value exceeding the expected length, potentially resulting in command execution or denial of service attacks.",
