  "description": "In com_android_internal_os_ZygoteCommandBuffer_nativeForkRepeatedly of com_android_internal_os_ZygoteCommandBuffer.cpp, there is a possible method to perform arbitrary code execution in any app zygote processes due to a logic error in the code. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
