  "description": "TOTOLINK AC1200 Wireless Router A3002R Firmware V1.1.1-B20200824 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. In the boa server programs CGI handling function formWlEncrypt, there is a lack of length restriction on the wlan_ssid field. This oversight leads to potential buffer overflow under specific circumstances. For instance, by invoking the formWlanRedirect function with specific parameters to alter wlan_idxs value and subsequently invoking the formWlEncrypt function, an attacker can trigger buffer overflow, enabling arbitrary command execution or denial of service attacks.",
