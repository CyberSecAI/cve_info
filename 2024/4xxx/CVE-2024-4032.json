    "description": "The ipaddress module contained incorrect information about whether certain IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were designated as globally reachable or private. This affected the is_private and is_global properties of the ipaddress.IPv4Address, ipaddress.IPv4Network, ipaddress.IPv6Address, and ipaddress.IPv6Network classes, where values wouldnt be returned in accordance with the latest information from the IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries. CPython 3.12.4 and 3.13.0a6 contain updated information from these registries and thus have the intended behavior.",
