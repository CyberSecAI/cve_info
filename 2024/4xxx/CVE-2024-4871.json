    "description": "A vulnerability was found in Satellite. When running a remote execution job on a host, the hosts SSH key is not being checked. When the key changes, the Satellite still connects it because it uses -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no. This flaw can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM), denial of service, leaking of secrets the remote execution job contains, or other issues that may arise from the attackers ability to forge an SSH key. This issue does not directly allow unauthorized remote execution on the Satellite, although it can leak secrets that may lead to it.",
