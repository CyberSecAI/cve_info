    "description": "A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui, specifically within the open_file module, version 9.5. The vulnerability arises due to improper neutralization of special elements used in a command within the open_file function. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious file path that, when processed by the open_file function, executes arbitrary system commands or reads sensitive file content. This issue is present in the code where subprocess.Popen is used unsafely to open files based on user-supplied paths without adequate validation, leading to potential command injection.",
