    "description": "This vulnerability exists in Digisol Router (DG-GR1321 Hardware version 3.7L Firmware version v3.2.02) due to lack of encryption or hashing in storing of passwords within the routers firmware/ database. An attacker with physical access could exploit this by extracting the firmware and reverse engineer the binary data to access the plaintext passwords on the vulnerable system. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the targeted system.",
