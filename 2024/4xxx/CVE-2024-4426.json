    "description": "The Comparison Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions hooked to AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change slider titles, delete sliders and modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
