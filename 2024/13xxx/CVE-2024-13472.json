This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. The same sc_attrs parameter is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting as well.",
