    "description": "The Page Builder Pagelayer Drag and Drop website builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugins Button widget in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 1.9.9 and completely fixed in version 2.0.1.",
