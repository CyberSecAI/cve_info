    "description": "Android based smartphones from vendors such as Ulefone and Krger&Matz contain com.pri.factorytest application preloaded onto devices during manufacturing process. The application com.pri.factorytest (version name 1.0, version code 1) exposes a com.pri.factorytest.emmc.FactoryResetService service allowing any application to perform a factory reset of the device. Application update did not increment the APK version. Instead, it was bundled in OS builds released later than December 2024 (Ulefone) and April 2025 (Krger&Matz).",
