    "description": "The BuddyBoss Platform plugin and BuddyBoss Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the invitee_name parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.50 and 2.8.41, respectively, due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in the BuddyBoss Platform plugin in version 2.8.41.",
