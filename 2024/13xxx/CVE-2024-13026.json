    "description": "A vulnerability exists in Algo Edge up to 2.1.1 - a previously used (legacy) component of navify Algorithm Suite. The vulnerability impacts the authentication mechanism of this component and could allow an attacker with adjacent access to the laboratory network and the Algo Edge system to craft valid authentication tokens and access the component. Other components of navify Algorithm Suite are not affected.",
