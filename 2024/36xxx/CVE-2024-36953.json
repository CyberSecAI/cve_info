    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM arm64 vgic-v2 Check for non-NULL vCPU in vgic_v2_parse_attr() vgic_v2_parse_attr() is responsible for finding the vCPU that matches the user-provided CPUID, which (of course) may not be valid. If the ID is invalid, kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() returns NULL, which isnt handled gracefully. Similar to the GICv3 uaccess flow, check that kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() actually returns something and fail the ioctl if not.",
