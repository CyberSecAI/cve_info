    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mmc sdhci-msm pervent access to suspended controller Generic sdhci code registers LED device and uses host->runtime_suspended flag to protect access to it. The sdhci-msm driver doesnt set this flag, which causes a crash when LED is accessed while controller is runtime suspended. Fix this by setting the flag correctly.",
