  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Fix division by zero in setup_dsc_config When slice_height is 0, the division by slice_height in the calculation of the number of slices will cause a division by zero driver crash. This leaves the kernel in a state that requires a reboot. This patch adds a check to avoid the division by zero. The stack trace below is for the 6.8.4 Kernel. I reproduced the issue on a Z16 Gen 2 Lenovo Thinkpad with a Apple Studio Display monitor connected via Thunderbolt. The amdgpu driver crashed with this exception when I rebooted the system with the monitor connected. kernel ? die (arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c421 arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c434 arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c447) kernel ? do_trap (arch/x86/kernel/traps.c113 arch/x86/kernel/traps.c154) kernel ? setup_dsc_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c1053) amdgpu kernel ? do_error_trap (./arch/x86/include/asm/traps.h58 arch/x86/kernel/traps.c175) kernel ? setup_dsc_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c1053) amdgpu kernel ? exc_divide_error (arch/x86/kernel/traps.c194 (discriminator 2)) kernel ? setup_dsc_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c1053) amdgpu kernel ? asm_exc_divide_error (./arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h548) kernel ? setup_dsc_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c1053) amdgpu kernel dc_dsc_compute_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd",
