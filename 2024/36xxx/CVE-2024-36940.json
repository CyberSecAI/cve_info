    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved pinctrl core delete incorrect free in pinctrl_enable() The pctldev struct is allocated in devm_pinctrl_register_and_init(). Its a devm_ managed pointer that is freed by devm_pinctrl_dev_release(), so freeing it in pinctrl_enable() will lead to a double free. The devm_pinctrl_dev_release() function frees the pindescs and destroys the mutex as well.",
