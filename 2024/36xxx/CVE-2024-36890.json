    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/slab make __free(kfree) accept error pointers Currently, if an automatically freed allocation is an error pointer that will lead to a crash. An example of this is in wm831x_gpio_dbg_show(). 171char *label __free(kfree) = gpiochip_dup_line_label(chip, i) 172if (IS_ERR(label)) { 173dev_err(wm831x->dev, Failed to duplicate label\\n) 174continue 175 } The auto clean up function should check for error pointers as well, otherwise were going to keep hitting issues like this.",
