  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iommu/arm-smmu Use the correct type in nvidia_smmu_context_fault() This was missed because of the function pointer indirection. nvidia_smmu_context_fault() is also installed as a irq function, and the void * was changed to a struct arm_smmu_domain. Since the iommu_domain is embedded at a non-zero offset this causes nvidia_smmu_context_fault() to miscompute the offset. Fixup the types.
