    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved e1000e change usleep_range to udelay in PHY mdic access This is a partial revert of commit 6dbdd4de0362 (e1000e Workaround for sporadic MDI error on Meteor Lake systems). The referenced commit used usleep_range inside the PHY access routines, which are sometimes called from an atomic context. This can lead to a kernel panic in some scenarios, such as cable disconnection and reconnection on vPro systems. Solve this by changing the usleep_range calls back to udelay.",
