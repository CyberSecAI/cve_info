    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Reapply drm/qxl simplify qxl_fence_wait This reverts commit 07ed11afb68d94eadd4ffc082b97c2331307c5ea. Stephen Rostedt reports I went to run my tests on my VMs and the tests hung on boot up. Unfortunately, the most I ever got out was [ 93.607888] Testing event system initcall OK [ 93.667730] Running tests on all trace events [ 93.669757] Testing all events OK [ 95.631064] ------------[ cut here ]------------ Timed out after 60 seconds and further debugging points to a possible circular locking dependency between the console_owner locking and the worker pool locking. Reverting the commit allows Steves VM to boot to completion again. [ This may obviously result in the [TTM] Buffer eviction failed messages again, which was the reason for that original revert. But at this point this seems preferable to a non-booting system... ]",
