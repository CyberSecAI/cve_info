    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i40e Do not use WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag for workqueue Issue reported by customer during SRIOV testing, call trace When both i40e and the i40iw driver are loaded, a warning in check_flush_dependency is being triggered. This seems to be because of the i40e driver workqueue is allocated with the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag, and the i40iw one is not. Similar error was encountered on ice too and it was fixed by removing the flag. Do the same for i40e too.
