    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved powerpc/pseries/iommu LPAR panics during boot up with a frozen PE At the time of LPAR boot up, partition firmware provides Open Firmware property ibm,dma-window for the PE. This property is provided on the PCI bus the PE is attached to. There are execptions where the partition firmware might not provide this property for the PE at the time of LPAR boot up. One of the scenario is where the firmware has frozen the PE due to some error condition. This PE is frozen for 24 hours or unless the whole system is reinitialized. Within this time frame, if the LPAR is booted, the frozen PE will be presented to the LPAR but ibm,dma-window property could be missing. Today, under these circumstances, the LPAR oopses with NULL pointer dereference, when configuring the PCI bus the PE is attached to.
