    "description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (attack 2). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run (attack 1). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (attack 3a and attack 3b). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for this issue.",
