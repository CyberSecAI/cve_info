    "description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).If an MX Series device receives PTP packets on an MPC3E that doesnt support PTP this causes a memory leak which will result in unpredictable behavior and ultimately in an MPC crash and restart.To monitor for this issue, please use the following FPC vty level commandsshow heapshows an increase in LAN buffer utilization andshow clksync ptp nbr-upd-infoshows non-zero Pending PFEs counter.This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC3E * All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S3 * 21.1 versions earlier than 21.1R3-S4 * 21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3 * 21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R2-S1, 21.3R3 * 21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R2 * 22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R2.",
