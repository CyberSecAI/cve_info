    "description": "Ursa is a cryptographic library for use with blockchains. The revocation schema that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model, allowing a malicious holder of a revoked credential to generate a valid Non-Revocation Proof for that credential as part of an AnonCreds presentation. A verifier may verify a credential from a holder as being not revoked when in fact, the holders credential has been revoked. Ursa has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.",
