    "description": "A security agent manual scan command injection vulnerability in the Trend Micro Deep Security 20 Agent could allow an attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code on an affected machine. In certain circumstances, attackers that have legitimate access to the domain may be able to remotely inject commands to other machines in the same domain. Please note an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability locally and must have domain user privileges to affect other machines.",
