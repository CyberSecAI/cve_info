    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved userfaultfd dont BUG_ON() if khugepaged yanks our page table Since khugepaged was changed to allow retracting page tables in file mappings without holding the mmap lock, these BUG_ON()s are wrong - get rid of them. We could also remove the preceding if (unlikely(...)) block, but then we could reach pte_offset_map_lock() with transhuge pages not just for file mappings but also for anonymous mappings - which would probably be fine but I think is not necessarily expected.",
