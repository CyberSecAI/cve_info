    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mptcp pm fix ID 0 endp usage after multiple re-creations local_addr_used and add_addr_accepted are decremented for addresses not related to the initial subflow (ID0), because the source and destination addresses of the initial subflows are known from the beginning they dont count as additional local address being used or ADD_ADDR being accepted. It is then required not to increment them when the entrypoint used by the initial subflow is removed and re-added during a connection. Without this modification, this entrypoint cannot be removed and re-added more than once.",
