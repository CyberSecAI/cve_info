    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi aacraid Fix double-free on probe failure aac_probe_one() calls hardware-specific init functions through the aac_driver_identinit pointer, all of which eventually call down to aac_init_adapter(). If aac_init_adapter() fails after allocating memory for aac_devqueues, it frees the memory but does not clear that member. After the hardware-specific init function returns an error, aac_probe_one() goes down an error path that frees the memory pointed to by aac_devqueues, resulting.in a double-free.",
