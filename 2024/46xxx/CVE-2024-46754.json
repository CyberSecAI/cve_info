    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Remove tst_run from lwt_seg6local_prog_ops. The syzbot reported that the lwt_seg6 related BPF ops can be invoked via bpf_test_run() without without entering input_action_end_bpf() first. Martin KaFai Lau said that self test for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL probably didnt work since it was introduced in commit 04d4b274e2a (ipv6 sr Add seg6local action End.BPF). The reason is that the per-CPU variable seg6_bpf_srh_statessrh is never assigned in the self test case but each BPF function expects it. Remove test_run for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL.",
