    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nfsd fix nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict in presence of third party lease It is not safe to dereference fl->c.flc_owner without first confirming fl->fl_lmops is the expected manager. nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict() tests fl_lmops but largely ignores the result and assumes that flc_owner is an nfs4_delegation anyway. This is wrong. With this patch we restore the != &nfsd_lease_mng_ops case to behave as it did before the change mentioned below. This is the same as the current code, but without any reference to a possible delegation.",
