    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/vmwgfx Prevent unmapping active read buffers The kms paths keep a persistent map active to read and compare the cursor buffer. These maps can race with each other in simple scenario where a) buffer a mapped for update b) buffer a mapped for compare c) do the compare d) unmap a for compare e) update the cursor f) unmap a for update At step e the buffer has been unmapped and the read contents is bogus. Prevent unmapping of active read buffers by simply keeping a count of how many paths have currently active maps and unmap only when the count reaches 0.",
