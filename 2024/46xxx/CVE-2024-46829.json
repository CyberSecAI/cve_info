    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved rtmutex Drop rt_mutexwait_lock before scheduling rt_mutex_handle_deadlock() is called with rt_mutexwait_lock held. In the good case it returns with the lock held and in the deadlock case it emits a warning and goes into an endless scheduling loop with the lock held, which triggers the scheduling in atomic warning. Unlock rt_mutexwait_lock in the dead lock case before issuing the warning and dropping into the schedule for ever loop. [ tglx Moved unlock before the WARN(), removed the pointless comment, massaged changelog, added Fixes tag ]",
