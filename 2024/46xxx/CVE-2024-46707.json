    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM arm64 Make ICC_*SGI*_EL1 undef in the absence of a vGICv3 On a system with a GICv3, if a guest hasnt been configured with GICv3 and that the host is not capable of GICv2 emulation, a write to any of the ICC_*SGI*_EL1 registers is trapped to EL2. We therefore try to emulate the SGI access, only to hit a NULL pointer as no private interrupt is allocated (no GIC, remember?). The obvious fix is to give the guest what it deserves, in the shape of a UNDEF exception.",
