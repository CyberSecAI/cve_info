    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved codetag debug mark codetags for poisoned page as empty When PG_hwpoison pages are freed they are treated differently in free_pages_prepare() and instead of being released they are isolated. Page allocation tag counters are decremented at this point since the page is considered not in use. Later on when such pages are released by unpoison_memory(), the allocation tag counters will be decremented again and the following warning gets reported [ 113.930443][ T3282] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [ 113.931105][ T3282] alloc_tag was not set [ 113.931576][ T3282] WARNING CPU 2 PID 3282 at ./include/linux/alloc_tag.h130 pgalloc_tag_sub.part.66+0x154/0x164 [ 113.932866][ T3282] Modules linked in hwpoison_inject fuse ip6t_rpfilter ip6t_REJECT nf_reject_ipv6 ipt_REJECT nf_reject_ipv4 xt_conntrack ebtable_nat ebtable_broute ip6table_nat ip6table_man4 [ 113.941638][ T3282] CPU 2 UID 0 PID 3282 Comm madvise11 Kdump loaded Tainted G W 6.11.0-rc4-dirty #18 [ 113.943003][ T3282] Tainted [W]=WARN [ 113.943453][ T3282] Hardware name QEMU KVM Virtual Machine, BIOS unknown 2/2/2022 [ 113.944378][ T3282] pstate 40400005 (nZcv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--) [ 113.945319][ T3282] pc pgalloc_tag_sub.part.66+0x154/0x164 [ 113.946016][ T3282] lr pgalloc_tag_sub.part.66+0x154/0x164 [ 113.946706][ T3282] sp ffff800087093a10 [ 113.947197][ T3282] x29 ffff800087093a10"
