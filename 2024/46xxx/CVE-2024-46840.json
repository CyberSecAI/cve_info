    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs clean up our handling of refs == 0 in snapshot delete In reada we BUG_ON(refs == 0), which could be unkind since we arent holding a lock on the extent leaf and thus could get a transient incorrect answer. In walk_down_proc we also BUG_ON(refs == 0), which could happen if we have extent tree corruption. Change that to return -EUCLEAN. In do_walk_down() we catch this case and handle it correctly, however we return -EIO, which -EUCLEAN is a more appropriate error code. Finally in walk_up_proc we have the same BUG_ON(refs == 0), so convert that to proper error handling. Also adjust the error message so we can actually do something with the information.",
