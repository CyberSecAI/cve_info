    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved kunit/overflow Fix UB in overflow_allocation_test The device_name array doesnt exist out of the overflow_allocation_test function scope. However, it is being used as a driver name when calling kunit_driver_create from kunit_device_register. It produces the kernel panic with KASAN enabled. Since this variable is used in one place only, remove it and pass the device name into kunit_device_register directly as an ascii string.",
