    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved soc qcom pmic_glink Fix race during initialization As pointed out by Stephen Boyd it is possible that during initialization of the pmic_glink child drivers, the protection-domain notifiers fires, and the associated work is scheduled, before the client registration returns and as a result the local client pointer has been initialized. The outcome of this is a NULL pointer dereference as the client pointer is blindly dereferenced.
