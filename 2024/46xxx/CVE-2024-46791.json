    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved can mcp251x fix deadlock if an interrupt occurs during mcp251x_open The mcp251x_hw_wake() function is called with the mpc_lock mutex held and disables the interrupt handler so that no interrupts can be processed while waking the device. If an interrupt has already occurred then waiting for the interrupt handler to complete will deadlock because it will be trying to acquire the same mutex.
