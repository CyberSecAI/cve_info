    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amdgpu/vcn remove irq disabling in vcn 5 suspend We do not directly enable/disable VCN IRQ in vcn 5.0.0. And we do not handle the IRQ state as well. So the calls to disable IRQ and set state are removed. This effectively gets rid of the warining of WARN_ON(!amdgpu_irq_enabled(adev, src, type)) in amdgpu_irq_put().",
