    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/vmwgfx Fix prime with external buffers Make sure that for external buffers mapping goes through the dma_buf interface instead of trying to access pages directly. External buffers might not provide direct access to readable/writable pages so to make sure the bos created from external dma_bufs can be read dma_buf interface has to be used. Fixes crashes in IGTs kms_prime with vgem. Regular desktop usage wont trigger this due to the fact that virtual machines will not have multiple GPUs but it enables better test coverage in IGT.",
