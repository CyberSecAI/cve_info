    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/mlx5 Move events notifier registration to be after device registration Move pkey change work initialization and cleanup from device resources stage to notifier stage, since this is the stage which handles this work events. Fix a race between the device deregistration and pkey change work by moving MLX5_IB_STAGE_DEVICE_NOTIFIER to be after MLX5_IB_STAGE_IB_REG in order to ensure that the notifier is deregistered before the device during cleanup. Which ensures there are no works that are being executed after the device has already unregistered which can cause the panic below.",
