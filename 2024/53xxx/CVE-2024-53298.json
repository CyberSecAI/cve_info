    "description": "Dell PowerScale OneFS, versions 9.5.0.0 through 9.10.0.1, contains a missing authorization vulnerability in the NFS export. An unauthenticated attacker with remote access could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to unauthorized filesystem access. The attacker may be able to read, modify, and delete arbitrary files. This vulnerability is considered critical as it can be leveraged to fully compromise the system. Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.",
