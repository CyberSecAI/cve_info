    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter ipset add missing range check in bitmap_ip_uadt When tb[IPSET_ATTR_IP_TO] is not present but tb[IPSET_ATTR_CIDR] exists, the values of ip and ip_to are slightly swapped. Therefore, the range check for ip should be done later, but this part is missing and it seems that the vulnerability occurs. So we should add missing range checks and remove unnecessary range checks.",
