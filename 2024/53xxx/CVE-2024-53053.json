    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi ufs core Fix another deadlock during RTC update If ufshcd_rtc_work calls ufshcd_rpm_put_sync() and the pms usage_count is 0, we will enter the runtime suspend callback. However, the runtime suspend callback will wait to flush ufshcd_rtc_work, causing a deadlock. Replace ufshcd_rpm_put_sync() with ufshcd_rpm_put() to avoid the deadlock.",
