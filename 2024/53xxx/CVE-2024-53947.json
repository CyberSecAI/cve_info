Specifically, certain engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Supersets SQL authorization. This issue is a follow-up toCVE-2024-39887 with additional disallowed PostgreSQL functions now includedquery_to_xml_and_xmlschema,table_to_xml,table_to_xml_and_xmlschema. This issue affects Apache Superset <4.1.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.0, which fixes the issue or add these Postgres functions to the config setDISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS.",
