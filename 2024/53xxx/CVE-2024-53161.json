    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved EDAC/bluefield Fix potential integer overflow The 64-bit argument for the get DIMM info SMC call consists of mem_ctrl_idx left-shifted 16 bits and OR-ed with DIMM index. With mem_ctrl_idx defined as 32-bits wide the left-shift operation truncates the upper 16 bits of information during the calculation of the SMC argument. The mem_ctrl_idx stack variable must be defined as 64-bits wide to prevent any potential integer overflow, i.e. loss of data from upper 16 bits.",
