    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vdpa solidrun Fix UB bug with devres In psnet_open_pf_bar() and snet_open_vf_bar() a string later passed to pcim_iomap_regions() is placed on the stack. Neither pcim_iomap_regions() nor the functions it calls copy that string. Should the string later ever be used, this, consequently, causes undefined behavior since the stack frame will by then have disappeared. Fix the bug by allocating the strings on the heap through devm_kasprintf().",
