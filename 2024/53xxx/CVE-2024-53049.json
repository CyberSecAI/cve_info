    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved slub/kunit fix a WARNING due to unwrapped __kmalloc_cache_noprof modprobe slub_kunit will have a warning as shown below. The root cause is that __kmalloc_cache_noprof was directly used, which resulted in no alloc_tag being allocated. This caused current->alloc_tag to be null, leading to a warning in alloc_tag_add_check. Lets add an alloc_hook layer to __kmalloc_cache_noprof specifically within lib/slub_kunit.c, which is the only user of this internal slub function outside kmalloc implementation itself.",
