    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ceph give up on paths longer than PATH_MAX If the full path to be built by ceph_mdsc_build_path() happens to be longer than PATH_MAX, then this function will enter an endless (retry) loop, effectively blocking the whole task. Most of the machine becomes unusable, making this a very simple and effective DoS vulnerability. I cannot imagine why this retry was ever implemented, but it seems rather useless and harmful to me. Lets remove it and fail with ENAMETOOLONG instead.",
