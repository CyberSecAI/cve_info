    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ALSA 6fire Release resources at card release The current 6fire code tries to release the resources right after the call of usb6fire_chip_abort(). But at this moment, the card object might be still in use (as were calling snd_card_free_when_closed()). For avoid potential UAFs, move the release of resources to the cards private_free instead of the manual call of usb6fire_chip_destroy() at the USB disconnect callback.",
