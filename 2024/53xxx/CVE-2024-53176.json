    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved smb During unmount, ensure all cached dir instances drop their dentry The unmount process (cifs_kill_sb() calling close_all_cached_dirs()) can race with various cached directory operations, which ultimately results in dentries not being dropped and these kernel BUGs BUG Dentry ffff88814f37e358{i=1000000000080,n=/} still in use (2) [unmount of cifs cifs] VFS Busy inodes after unmount of cifs (cifs) ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel BUG at fs/super.c661! This happens when a cfid is in the process of being cleaned up when, and has been removed from the cfids->entries list, including - Receiving a lease break from the server - Server reconnection triggers invalidate_all_cached_dirs(), which removes all the cfids from the list - The laundromat thread decides to expire an old cfid. To solve these problems, dropping the dentry is done in queued work done in a newly-added cfid_put_wq workqueue, and close_all_cached_dirs() flushes that workqueue after it drops all the dentries of which its aware. This is a global workqueue (rather than scoped to a mount), but the queued work is minimal. The final cleanup work for cleaning up a cfid is performed via work queued in the serverclose_wq workqueue this is done separate from dropping the dentries so that close_all_cached_dirs() doesnt block on any server operations. Both of these queued works expect to invoked with a cfid reference and a tcon reference to avoid those objects from being freed while the work is ongoing. While were here, add proper locking to close_all_cached_dirs(), and locking around the freeing of cfid->dentry.",
