    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved regulator axp20x AXP717 set ramp_delay AXP717 datasheet says that regulator ramp delay is 15.625 us/step, which is 10mV in our case. Add a AXP_DESC_RANGES_DELAY macro and update AXP_DESC_RANGES macro to expand to AXP_DESC_RANGES_DELAY with ramp_delay = 0 For DCDC4, steps is 100mv Add a AXP_DESC_DELAY macro and update AXP_DESC macro to expand to AXP_DESC_DELAY with ramp_delay = 0 This patch fix crashes when using CPU DVFS.",
