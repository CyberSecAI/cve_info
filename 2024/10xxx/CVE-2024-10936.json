    "description": "The String locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.6 via deserialization of untrusted input in the recursive_unserialize_replace function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must perform a search and replace action to trigger the exploit.",
