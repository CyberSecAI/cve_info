    "description": "A vulnerability in the h2oai/h2o-3 REST API versions 3.46.0.4 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via deserialization of untrusted data. The vulnerability exists in the endpoints POST /99/ImportSQLTable and POST /3/SaveToHiveTable, where user-controlled JDBC URLs are passed to DriverManager.getConnection, leading to deserialization if a MySQL or PostgreSQL driver is available in the classpath. This issue is fixed in version 3.47.0.",
