    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved afs Fix the setting of the server responding flag In afs_wait_for_operation(), we set transcribe the call responded flag to the server record that we used after doing the fileserver iteration loop - but its possible to exit the loop having had a response from the server that weve discarded (e.g. it returned an abort or we started receiving data, but the call didnt complete). This means that op->server might be NULL, but we dont check that before attempting to set the server flag.",
