    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mailbox bcm2835 Fix timeout during suspend mode During noirq suspend phase the Raspberry Pi power driver suffer of firmware property timeouts. The reason is that the IRQ of the underlying BCM2835 mailbox is disabled and rpi_firmware_property_list() will always run into a timeout [1]. Since the VideoCore side isnt consider as a wakeup source, set the IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag for the mailbox IRQ in order to keep it enabled during suspend-resume cycle.
