    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Add NULL check for clk_mgr and clk_mgr->funcs in dcn30_init_hw This commit addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue in the `dcn30_init_hw` function. The issue could occur when `dc->clk_mgr` or `dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is null. The fix adds a check to ensure `dc->clk_mgr` and `dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is not null before accessing its functions. This prevents a potential null pointer dereference. Reported by smatch drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c789 dcn30_init_hw() error we previously assumed dc->clk_mgr could be null (see line 628)",
