    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Add null check for afb in amdgpu_dm_update_cursor (v2) This commit adds a null check for the afb variable in the amdgpu_dm_update_cursor function. Previously, afb was assumed to be null at line 8388, but was used later in the code without a null check. This could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference. Changes since v1 - Moved the null check for afb to the line where afb is used. (Alex) Fixes the below drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm.c8433 amdgpu_dm_update_cursor() error we previously assumed afb could be null (see line 8388)",
