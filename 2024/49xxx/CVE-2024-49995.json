    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tipc guard against string buffer overrun Smatch reports that copying media_name and if_name to name_parts may overwrite the destination. .../bearer.c166 bearer_name_validate() error strcpy() media_name too large for name_parts->media_name (32 vs 16) .../bearer.c167 bearer_name_validate() error strcpy() if_name too large for name_parts->if_name (1010102 vs 16) This does seem to be the case so guard against this possibility by using strscpy() and failing if truncation occurs. Introduced by commit b97bf3fd8f6a ([TIPC] Initial merge) Compile tested only.",
