    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Add null check for top_pipe_to_program in commit_planes_for_stream This commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in the `commit_planes_for_stream` function at line 4140. The issue could occur when `top_pipe_to_program` is null. The fix adds a check to ensure `top_pipe_to_program` is not null before accessing its stream_res. This prevents a null pointer dereference. Reported by smatch drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/core/dc.c4140 commit_planes_for_stream() error we previously assumed top_pipe_to_program could be null (see line 3906)",
