    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Add NULL check for function pointer in dcn32_set_output_transfer_func This commit adds a null check for the set_output_gamma function pointer in the dcn32_set_output_transfer_func function. Previously, set_output_gamma was being checked for null, but then it was being dereferenced without any null check. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if set_output_gamma is null. To fix this, we now ensure that set_output_gamma is not null before dereferencing it. We do this by adding a null check for set_output_gamma before the call to set_output_gamma.",
