    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf correctly handle malformed BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL relos In case of malformed relocation record of kind BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL referencing a non-existing BTF type, function bpf_core_calc_relo_insn would cause a null pointer deference. Fix this by adding a proper check upper in call stack, as malformed relocation records could be passed from user space. Simplest reproducer is a program r0 = 0 exit With a single relocation record .insn_off = 0, /* patch first instruction */ .type_id = 100500, /* this type id does not exist */ .access_str_off = 6, /* offset of string 0 */ .kind = BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL, See the link for original reproducer or next commit for a test case.",
