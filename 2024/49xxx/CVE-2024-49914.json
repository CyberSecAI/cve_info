    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Add null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe This commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in the `dcn20_program_pipe` function. The issue could occur when `pipe_ctx->plane_state` is null. The fix adds a check to ensure `pipe_ctx->plane_state` is not null before accessing. This prevents a null pointer dereference. Reported by smatch drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn20/dcn20_hwseq.c1925 dcn20_program_pipe() error we previously assumed pipe_ctx->plane_state could be null (see line 1877)",
