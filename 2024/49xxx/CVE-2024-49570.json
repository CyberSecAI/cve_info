    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe/tracing Fix a potential TP_printk UAF The commit afd2627f727b (tracing Check %s dereference via the field and not the TP_printk format) exposes potential UAFs in the xe_bo_move trace event. Fix those by avoiding dereferencing the xe_mem_type_to_name[] array at TP_printk time. Since some code refactoring has taken place, explicit backporting may be needed for kernels older than 6.10.",
