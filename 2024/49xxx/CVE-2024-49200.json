  "description": "An issue was discovered in AcpiS3SaveDxe and ChipsetSvcDxe in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.2 though 5.7. A potential DXE memory corruption vulnerability has been identified. The root cause is use of a pointer originating from the value of an NVRAM variable as the target of a write operation. This can be leveraged by an attacker to perform arbitrary writes, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The issue has been fixed in kernel 5.2, Version 05.29.44 kernel 5.3, Version 05.38.44 kernel 5.4, Version 05.46.44 kernel 5.5, Version 05.54.44 kernel 5.6, Version 05.61.44 and kernel 5.7, Version 05.70.44.",
