    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Add null check for head_pipe in dcn201_acquire_free_pipe_for_layer This commit addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue in the `dcn201_acquire_free_pipe_for_layer` function. The issue could occur when `head_pipe` is null. The fix adds a check to ensure `head_pipe` is not null before asserting it. If `head_pipe` is null, the function returns NULL to prevent a potential null pointer dereference. Reported by smatch drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/resource/dcn201/dcn201_resource.c1016 dcn201_acquire_free_pipe_for_layer() error we previously assumed head_pipe could be null (see line 1010)",
