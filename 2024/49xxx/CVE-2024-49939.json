  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi rtw89 avoid to add interface to list twice when SER If SER L2 occurs during the WoWLAN resume flow, the add interface flow is triggered by ieee80211_reconfig(). However, due to rtw89_wow_resume() return failure, it will cause the add interface flow to be executed again, resulting in a double add list and causing a kernel panic. Therefore, we have added a check to prevent double adding of the list. list_add double add new=ffff99d6992e2010, prev=ffff99d6992e2010, next=ffff99d695302628. ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c37! invalid opcode 0000",
