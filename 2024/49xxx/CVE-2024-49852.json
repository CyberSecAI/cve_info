  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi elx libefc Fix potential use after free in efc_nport_vport_del() The kref_put() function will call nport->release if the refcount drops to zero. The nport->release release function is _efc_nport_free() which frees nport. But then we dereference nport on the next line which is a use after free. Re-order these lines to avoid the use after free.",
