    "description": "The application Sensei Mac Cleaner contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing an attacker to perform multiple operations as the rootuser. These operations include arbitrary file deletion and writing, loading and unloading daemons, manipulating file permissions, and loading extensions, among other actions. The vulnerable moduleorg.cindori.SenseiHelpercan be contacted via XPC. While the module performs client validation, it relies on the clients PIDobtained through the public processIdentifierproperty of the NSXPCConnectionclass. This approach makes the module susceptible to a PID Reuse Attack, enabling an attacker to impersonate a legitimate client and send crafted XPC messages to invoke arbitrary methods exposed by the HelperProtocolinterface.",
