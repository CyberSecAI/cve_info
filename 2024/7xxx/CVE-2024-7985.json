  "description": "The FileOrganizer - Manage WordPress and Website Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the fileorganizer_ajax_handler function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and permissions granted by an administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE The FileOrganizer Pro plugin must be installed and active to allow Subscriber+ users to upload files.",
