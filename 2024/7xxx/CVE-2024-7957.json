    "description": "An arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability exists in the ZulipConnector of danswer-ai/danswer, affecting the latest version. The vulnerability arises from the load_credentials method, where user-controlled input for realm_name and zuliprc_content is used to construct file paths and write file contents. This allows attackers to overwrite or create arbitrary files if a zuliprc- directory already exists in the temporary directory.",
