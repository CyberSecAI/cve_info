The following vulnerabilities were reported to us by Sharon Brizinov of Claroty Research - Team82. A feature in the affected products enables users to prepare a project file with an embedded VBA script and can be configured to run once the project file has been opened without user intervention. This feature can be abused to trick a legitimate user into executing malicious code upon opening an infected RSP/RSS project file.
