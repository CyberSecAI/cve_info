  "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Automation License Manager V5 (All versions), Automation License Manager V6.0 (All versions), Automation License Manager V6.2 (All versions < V6.2 Upd3). Affected applications do not properly validate certain fields in incoming network packets on port 4410/tcp. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause an integer overflow and crash of the application. This denial of service condition could prevent legitimate users from using subsequent products that rely on the affected application for license verification.",
