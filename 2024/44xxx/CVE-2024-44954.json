    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ALSA line6 Fix racy access to midibuf There can be concurrent accesses to line6 midibuf from both the URB completion callback and the rawmidi API access. This could be a cause of KMSAN warning triggered by syzkaller below (so put as reported-by here).
