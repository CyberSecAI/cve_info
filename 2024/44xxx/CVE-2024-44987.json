    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ipv6 prevent UAF in ip6_send_skb() syzbot reported an UAF in ip6_send_skb() [1] After ip6_local_out() has returned, we no longer can safely dereference rt, unless we hold rcu_read_lock(). A similar issue has been fixed in commit a688caa34beb (ipv6 take rcu lock in rawv6_send_hdrinc()) Another potential issue in ip6_finish_output2() is handled in a separate patch.
