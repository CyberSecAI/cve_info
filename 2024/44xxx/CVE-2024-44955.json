    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Dont refer to dc_sink in is_dsc_need_re_compute [Why] When unplug one of monitors connected after mst hub, encounter null pointer dereference. Its due to dc_sink get released immediately in early_unregister() or detect_ctx(). When commit new state which directly referring to info stored in dc_sink will cause null pointer dereference. [how] Remove redundant checking condition. Relevant condition should already be covered by checking if dsc_aux is null or not. Also reset dsc_aux to NULL when the connector is disconnected.",
