    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vsock fix recursive ->recvmsg calls After a vsock socket has been added to a BPF sockmap, its prot->recvmsg has been replaced with vsock_bpf_recvmsg(). Thus the following recursiion could happen vsock_bpf_recvmsg() -> __vsock_recvmsg() -> vsock_connectible_recvmsg() -> prot->recvmsg() -> vsock_bpf_recvmsg() again We need to fix it by calling the original ->recvmsg() without any BPF sockmap logic in __vsock_recvmsg().",
