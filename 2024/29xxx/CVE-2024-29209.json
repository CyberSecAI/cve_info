  "description": "A medium severity vulnerability has been identified in the update mechanism of the Phish Alert Button for Outlook, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the host machine. The vulnerability arises from the applications failure to securely verify the authenticity and integrity of the update server. The application periodically checks for updates by querying a specific URL. However, this process does not enforce strict SSL/TLS verification, nor does it validate the digital signature of the received update files. An attacker with the capability to perform DNS spoofing can exploit this weakness. By manipulating DNS responses, the attacker can redirect the applications update requests to a malicious server under their control. Once the application queries the spoofed update URL, the malicious server can respond with a crafted update package. Since the application fails to properly verify the authenticity of the update file, it will accept and execute the package, leading to arbitrary code execution on the host machine. Impact Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code with elevated privileges, potentially leading to data theft, installation of further malware, or other malicious activities on the host system. Affected Products Phish Alert Button (PAB) for Outlook versions 1.10.0-1.10.11 Second Chance Client versions 2.0.0-2.0.9 PIQ Client versions 1.0.0-1.0.15 Remediation Automated updates will be pushed",
