In memos 0.13.2, an SSRF vulnerability exists at the /o/get/image that allows unauthenticated users to enumerate the internal network and retrieve images. The response from the image request is then copied into the response of the current server request, causing a reflected XSS vulnerability. Version 0.22.0 of memos removes the vulnerable file.",
