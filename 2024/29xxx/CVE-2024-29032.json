    "description": "Qiskit IBM Runtime is an environment that streamlines quantum computations and provides optimal implementations of the Qiskit quantum computing SDK. Starting in version 0.1.0 and prior to version 0.21.2, deserializing json data using `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder` can lead to arbitrary code execution given a correctly formatted input string. Version 0.21.2 contains a fix for this issue.",
