    "description": "TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCEs content insertion code. This allowed `iframe` elements containing malicious code to execute when inserted into the editor. These `iframe` elements are restricted in their permissions by same-origin browser protections, but could still trigger operations such as downloading of malicious assets. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.8.1.",
