  "description": "Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in Apache Airflow FTP Provider. The FTP hook lacks complete certificate validation in FTP_TLS connections, which can potentially be leveraged. Implementing proper certificate validation by passing context=ssl.create_default_context() during FTP_TLS instantiation is used as mitigation to validate the certificates properly. This issue affects Apache Airflow FTP Provider before 3.7.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.7.0, which fixes the issue.",
