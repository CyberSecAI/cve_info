    "description": "A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability existed in version (20240121) of gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt due to inadequate sanitization and validation of model output data. Despite user-input validation efforts, the application fails to properly sanitize or validate the output from the model, allowing for the injection and execution of malicious JavaScript code within the context of a users browser. This vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users browsers, potentially resulting in the hijacking of victims browsers.",
