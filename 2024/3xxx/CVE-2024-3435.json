  "description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the save_settings endpoint of the parisneo/lollms-webui application, affecting versions up to the latest release before 9.5. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient sanitization of the config parameter in the apply_settings function, allowing an attacker to manipulate the applications configuration by sending specially crafted JSON payloads. This could lead to remote code execution (RCE) by bypassing existing patches designed to mitigate such vulnerabilities.",
