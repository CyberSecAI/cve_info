    "description": "Concrete CMS versions 9 below 9.2.8 and versions below 8.5.16 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in the Advanced File Search Filter. Prior to the fix, a rogue administrator could add malicious code in the file manager because of insufficient validation of administrator provided data. All administrators have access to the File Manager and hence could create a search filter with the malicious code attached. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1 with a vector of AVN/ACH/PRH/UIR/SU/CN/IL/AL https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator .",
