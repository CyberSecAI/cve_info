    "description": "A command injection vulnerability exists in the run_xtts_api_server function of the parisneo/lollms-webui application, specifically within the lollms_xtts.py script. The vulnerability arises due to the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. The affected function utilizes subprocess.Popen to execute a command constructed with a Python f-string, without adequately sanitizing the xtts_base_url input. This flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands remotely by manipulating the xtts_base_url parameter. The vulnerability affects versions up to and including the latest version before 9.5. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary remote code execution (RCE) on the system where the application is deployed.",
