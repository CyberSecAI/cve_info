  "description": "The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to improper missing encryption exception handling on the fea_encrypt function in all versions up to, and including, 3.19.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate the user processing forms, which can be used to add and edit administrator user for privilege escalation, or to automatically log in users for authentication bypass, or manipulate the post processing form that can be used to inject arbitrary web scripts. This can only be exploited if the openssl php extension is not loaded on the server.",
