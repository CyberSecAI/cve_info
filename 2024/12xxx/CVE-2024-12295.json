    "description": "The BoomBox Theme Extensions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a users identity prior to updating their password through the boombox_ajax_reset_password function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level privileges and above, to change arbitrary users passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.",
