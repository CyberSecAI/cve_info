    "description": "The CarSpot Dealership Wordpress Classified Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a token prior to updating a users password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary users passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.",
