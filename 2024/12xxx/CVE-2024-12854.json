    "description": "The Garden Gnome Package plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the functionality that automatically extracts ggpkg files that have been uploaded in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.",
