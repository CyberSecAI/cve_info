  "description": "The tbm-client from Chunghwa Telecom has an Arbitrary File vulnerability. The application sets up a simple local web server and provides APIs for communication with the target website. Due to the lack of CSRF protection in the APIs, unauthenticated remote attackers could use these APIs through phishing. Additionally, one of the APIs contains an Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability. Attackers can copy arbitrary files on the users system and paste them into any path, which poses a potential risk of information leakage or could consume hard drive space by copying files in large volumes.",
