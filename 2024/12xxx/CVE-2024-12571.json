  "description": "The Store Locator for WordPress with Google Maps LotsOfLocales plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in version 3.98.9 via the sl_engine parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other safe file types can be uploaded and included.",
