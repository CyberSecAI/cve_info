  "description": "The Premium Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in all versions up to, and including, 4.10.33 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses and edits an injected element, and subsequently clicks the element with the mouse scroll wheel.",
