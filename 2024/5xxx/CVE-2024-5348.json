    "description": "The Elements For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.1 via the beforeafter_layout attribute of the beforeafter widget, the eventsgrid_layout attribute of the eventsgrid and list widgets, the marquee_layout attribute of the marquee widget, the postgrid_layout attribute of the postgrid widget, the woocart_layout attribute of the woocart widget, and the woogrid_layout attribute of the woogrid widget. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other safe file types can be uploaded and included.",
