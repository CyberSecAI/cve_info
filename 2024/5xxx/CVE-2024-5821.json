    "description": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the server by confusing the agent with incorrect file names. When a user requests the content of a file with a misspelled name, the agent attempts to correct the command and inadvertently reveals the content of the intended file, such as /etc/passwd. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential server compromise.",
