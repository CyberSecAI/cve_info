  "description": "A path traversal vulnerability in the get-project-files functionality of stitionai/devika allows attackers to read arbitrary files from the filesystem and cause a Denial of Service (DoS). This issue is present in all versions of the application. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient path sanitization for the project-name parameter, enabling attackers to specify paths that traverse the filesystem. By setting project-name to the root directory, an attacker can cause the application to attempt to read the entire filesystem, leading to a DoS condition.",
