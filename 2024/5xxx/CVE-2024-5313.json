    "description": "CWE-668 Exposure of the Resource Wrong Sphere vulnerability exists that exposes a SSH interface over the product network interface. This does not allow to directly exploit the product or make any unintended operation as the SSH interface access is protected by an authentication mechanism. Impacts are limited to port scanning and fingerprinting activities as well as attempts to perform a potential denial of service attack on the exposed SSH interface.",
