  "description": "Dropbox Desktop Folder Sharing Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of Dropbox Desktop. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of shared folders. When syncing files from a shared folder belonging to an untrusted account, the Dropbox desktop application does not apply the Mark-of-the-Web to the local files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-23991.",
