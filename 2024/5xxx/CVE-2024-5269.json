  "description": "Sonos Era 100 SMB2 Message Handling Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sonos Era 100 smart speakers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SMB2 messages. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-22459.",
