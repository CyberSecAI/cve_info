    "description": "An issue was discovered in Ubuntu wpa_supplicant that resulted in loading of arbitrary shared objects, which allows a local unprivileged attacker to escalate privileges to the user that wpa_supplicant runs as (usually root). Membership in the netdev group or access to the dbus interface of wpa_supplicant allow an unprivileged user to specify an arbitrary path to a module to be loaded by the wpa_supplicant process other escalation paths might exist.",
