    "description": "The Use of a Hard-coded Cryptographic Key vulnerability in Juniper Networks Juniper Cloud Native Router (JCNR) and containerized routing Protocol Deamon (cRPD) products allows an attacker to perform Person-in-the-Middle (PitM) attacks which results in complete compromise of the container. Due to hardcoded SSH host keys being present on the container, a PitM attacker can intercept SSH traffic without being detected. This issue affects Juniper Networks JCNR * All versions before 23.4. This issue affects Juniper Networks cRPD * All versions before 23.4R1.",
