    "description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to send a specific routing update, causing an rpd core due to memory corruption, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This issue can only be triggered when the system is configured for CoS-based forwarding (CBF) with a policy map containing a cos-next-hop-map action (see below). This issue affects Junos OS * all versions before 20.4R3-S10, * from 21.2 before 21.2R3-S8, * from 21.3 before 21.3R3, * from 21.4 before 21.4R3, * from 22.1 before 22.1R2 Junos OS Evolved * all versions before 21.2R3-S8-EVO, * from 21.3 before 21.3R3-EVO, * from 21.4 before 21.4R3-EVO, * from 22.1 before 22.1R2-EVO.",
