    "description": "An Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a limited Denial of Service (DoS) to the management plane. When an incoming connection was blocked because it exceeded the connections-per-second rate-limit, the system doesnt consider existing connections anymore for subsequent connection attempts so that the connection limit can be exceeded. This issue affects Junos OS Evolved * All versions before 21.4R3-S4-EVO, * 22.1-EVO versions before 22.1R3-S3-EVO, * 22.2-EVO versions before 22.2R3-S2-EVO, * 22.3-EVO versions before 22.3R2-S1-EVO, 22.3R3-EVO.",
