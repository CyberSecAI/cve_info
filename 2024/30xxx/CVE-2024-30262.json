    "description": "Contao is an open source content management system. Prior to version 4.13.40, when a frontend member changes their password in the personal data or the password lost module, the corresponding remember-me tokens are not removed. If someone compromises an account and is able to get a remember-me token, changing the password would not be enough to reclaim control over the account. Version 4.13.40 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, disable Allow auto login in the login module.",
