    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/smc reduce rtnl pressure in smc_pnet_create_pnetids_list() Many syzbot reports show extreme rtnl pressure, and many of them hint that smc acquires rtnl in netns creation for no good reason [1] This patch returns early from smc_pnet_net_init() if there is no netdevice yet. I am not even sure why smc_pnet_create_pnetids_list() even exists, because smc_pnet_netdev_event() is also calling smc_pnet_add_base_pnetid() when handling NETDEV_UP event.
