    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved block fix module reference leakage from bdev_open_by_dev error path At the time bdev_may_open() is called, module reference is grabbed already, hence module reference should be released if bdev_may_open() failed. This problem is found by code review.",
