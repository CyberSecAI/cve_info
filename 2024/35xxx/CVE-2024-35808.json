    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved md/dm-raid dont call md_reap_sync_thread() directly Currently md_reap_sync_thread() is called from raid_message() directly without holding reconfig_mutex, this is definitely unsafe because md_reap_sync_thread() can change many fields that is protected by reconfig_mutex. However, hold reconfig_mutex here is still problematic because this will cause deadlock, for example, commit 130443d60b1b (md refactor idle/frozen_sync_thread() to fix deadlock). Fix this problem by using stop_sync_thread() to unregister sync_thread, like md/raid did.",
