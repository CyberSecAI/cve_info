    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter complete validation of user input In my recent commit, I missed that do_replace() handlers use copy_from_sockptr() (which I fixed), followed by unsafe copy_from_sockptr_offset() calls. In all functions, we can perform the @optlen validation before even calling xt_alloc_table_info() with the following check if ((u64)optlen < (u64)tmp.size + sizeof(tmp)) return -EINVAL",
