    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved idpf fix kernel panic on unknown packet types In the very rare case where a packet type is unknown to the driver, idpf_rx_process_skb_fields would return early without calling eth_type_trans to set the skb protocol / the network layer handler. This is especially problematic if tcpdump is running when such a packet is received, i.e. it would cause a kernel panic. Instead, call eth_type_trans for every single packet, even when the packet type is unknown.",
