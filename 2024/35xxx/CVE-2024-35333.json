    "description": "A stack-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the read_charset_decl function of html2xhtml 1.3. This vulnerability occurs due to improper bounds checking when copying data into a fixed-size stack buffer. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input to the vulnerable function, causing a buffer overflow and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or data corruption.",
