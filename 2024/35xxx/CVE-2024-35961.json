    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolvednet/mlx5 Register devlink first under devlink lockIn case device is having a non fatal FW error during probe, thedriver will report the error to user via devlink. This will triggera WARN_ON, since mlx5 is calling devlink_register() last.In order to avoid the WARN_ON[1], change mlx5 to invoke devl_register()first under devlink lock.[1]WARNING CPU 5 PID 227 at net/devlink/health.c483 devlink_recover_notify.constprop.0+0xb8/0xc0CPU 5 PID 227 Comm kworker/u163 Not tainted 6.4.0-rc5_for_upstream_min_debug_2023_06_12_12_38 #1Hardware name QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.13.0-0-gf21b5a4aeb02-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014Workqueue mlx5_health00000800.0 mlx5_fw_reporter_err_work [mlx5_core]RIP 0010devlink_recover_notify.constprop.0+0xb8/0xc0Call Trace ? __warn+0x79/0x120 ? devlink_recover_notify.constprop.0+0xb8/0xc0 ? report_bug+0x17c/0x190 ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x60 ? exc_invalid_op+0x14/0x70 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20 ? devlink_recover_notify.constprop.0+0xb8/0xc0 devlink_health_report+0x4a/0x1c0 mlx5_fw_reporter_err_work+0xa4/0xd0 [mlx5_core] process_one_work+0x1bb/0x3c0 ? process_one_work+0x3c0/0x3c0 worker_thread+0x4d/0x3c0 ? process_one_work+0x3c0/0x3c0 kthread+0xc6/0xf0 ? kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20 ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30",
