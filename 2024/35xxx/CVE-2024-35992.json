    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved phy marvell a3700-comphy Fix out of bounds read There is an out of bounds read access of gbe_phy_init_fix[fix_idx].addr every iteration after fix_idx reaches ARRAY_SIZE(gbe_phy_init_fix). Make sure gbe_phy_init[addr] is used when all elements of gbe_phy_init_fix array are handled. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
