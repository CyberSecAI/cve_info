    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Bluetooth qca fix NULL-deref on non-serdev suspend Qualcomm ROME controllers can be registered from the Bluetooth line discipline and in this case the HCI UART serdev pointer is NULL. Add the missing sanity check to prevent a NULL-pointer dereference when wakeup() is called for a non-serdev controller during suspend. Just return true for now to restore the original behaviour and address the crash with pre-6.2 kernels, which do not have commit e9b3e5b8c657 (Bluetooth hci_qca only assign wakeup with serial port support) that causes the crash to happen already at setup() time.",
