    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb typec altmodes/displayport create sysfs nodes as drivers default device attribute group The DisplayPort drivers sysfs nodes may be present to the userspace before typec_altmode_set_drvdata() completes in dp_altmode_probe. This means that a sysfs read can trigger a NULL pointer error by deferencing dp->hpd in hpd_show or dp->lock in pin_assignment_show, as dev_get_drvdata() returns NULL in those cases. Remove manual sysfs node creation in favor of adding attribute group as default for devices bound to the driver. The ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS() macro is not used here otherwise the path to the sysfs nodes is no longer compliant with the ABI.",
