    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved soc fsl qbman Use raw spinlock for cgr_lock smp_call_function always runs its callback in hard IRQ context, even on PREEMPT_RT, where spinlocks can sleep. So we need to use a raw spinlock for cgr_lock to ensure we arent waiting on a sleeping task. Although this bug has existed for a while, it was not apparent until commit ef2a8d5478b9 (net dpaa Adjust queue depth on rate change) which invokes smp_call_function_single via qman_update_cgr_safe every time a link goes up or down.",
