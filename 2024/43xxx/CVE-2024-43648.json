  "description": "Command injection in the parameter of a .exe request leads to remote code execution as the root user. This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701. Likelihood Moderate This action is not a common place for command injection vulnerabilities to occur. Thus, an attacker will likely only be able to find this vulnerability by reverse-engineering the firmware or trying it on all fields. The attacker will also need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the binary, or convince a user with such access to execute a payload. Impact Critical The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and delete files and services. CVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AVN), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (ACL), the attack does not rely on preconditions (ATN). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PRL), it does not require user interaction (UIN). If is a full system compromise, potentially fully compromising confidentiality, integrity and availability of the devicer (VCH/VIH/VAH). A compromised charger can be used to pivot onto networks that should otherwise be closed, cause a low confidentiality and interity impact on subsequent systems. (SCL/SIL/SAH). Because this device is an EV charger handing significant amounts of power, we suspect this vulnerability can have a safety impact (SP). The attack can be automated (AUY).",
