    "description": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (Command Injection) vulnerability allows OS Command Injection as root This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC model chargers before version 24120701. Likelihood High. However, the attacker will need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the action.exe CGI binary and upload the crafted firmware file, or convince a user with such access to upload it. Impact Critical The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and deletefiles and services. CVSS clarification Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AVN) and there are not additional security measures to circumvent (ACL), nor does the attack require and existing preconditions (ATN). The attack is authenticated, but the level of authentication does not matter (PRL), nor is any user interaction required (UIN). The attack leads to a full compromised (VCH/VIH/VAH), and compromised devices can be used to pivot into networks that should potentially not be accessible (SCL/SIL/SAH). Becuase this is an EV charger handing significant power, there is a potential safety impact (SP). This attack can be automated (AUY).",
