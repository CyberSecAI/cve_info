    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vhost/vsock always initialize seqpacket_allow There are two issues around seqpacket_allow 1. seqpacket_allow is not initialized when socket is created. Thus if features are never set, it will be read uninitialized. 2. if VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_SEQPACKET is set and then cleared, then seqpacket_allow will not be cleared appropriately (existing apps I know about dont usually do this but its legal and theres no way to be sure no one relies on this). To fix - initialize seqpacket_allow after allocation - set it unconditionally in set_features",
