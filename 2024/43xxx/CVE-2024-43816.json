    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi lpfc Revise lpfc_prep_embed_io routine with proper endian macro usages On big endian architectures, it is possible to run into a memory out of bounds pointer dereference when FCP targets are zoned. In lpfc_prep_embed_io, the memcpy(ptr, fcp_cmnd, sgl->sge_len) is referencing a little endian formatted sgl->sge_len value. So, the memcpy can cause big endian systems to crash. Redefine the *sgl ptr as a struct sli4_sge_le to make it clear that we are referring to a little endian formatted data structure. And, update the routine with proper le32_to_cpu macro usages.",
