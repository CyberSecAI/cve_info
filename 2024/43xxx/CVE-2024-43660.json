    "description": "The CGI script .sh can be used to download any file on the filesystem. This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC model chargers beforeversion 24120701. Likelihood High, but credentials required. Impact Critical The script can be used to download any file on the filesystem, including sensitive files such as /etc/shadow, the CGI script source code or binaries and configuration files. CVSS4.0/AVN/ACL/ATN/PRL/UIN/VCH/VIN/VAN/SCN/SIN/SAN/SP/AUY CVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AVN), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (ACL), the attack does not rely on preconditions (ATN). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PRL), it does not require user interaction (UIN). The confidentiality of all files of the devicd can be compromised (VCH/VIN/VAN). There is no impact on subsequent systems. (SCN/SIN/SAN). While this device is an EV charger handing significant amounts of power, this attack in isolation does not have a safety impact. The attack can be automated (AUY).",
