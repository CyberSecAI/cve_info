    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/hns Fix soft lockup under heavy CEQE load CEQEs are handled in interrupt handler currently. This may cause the CPU core staying in interrupt context too long and lead to soft lockup under heavy load. Handle CEQEs in BH workqueue and set an upper limit for the number of CEQE handled by a single call of work handler.",
