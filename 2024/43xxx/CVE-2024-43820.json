    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved dm-raid Fix WARN_ON_ONCE check for sync_thread in raid_resume rm-raid devices will occasionally trigger the following warning when being resumed after a table load because DM_RECOVERY_RUNNING is set WARNING CPU 7 PID 5660 at drivers/md/dm-raid.c4105 raid_resume+0xee/0x100 [dm_raid] The failing check is WARN_ON_ONCE(test_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery)) This check is designed to make sure that the sync thread isnt registered, but md_check_recovery can set MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING without the sync_thread ever getting registered. Instead of checking if MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING is set, check if sync_thread is non-NULL.",
