    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Add NULL check for afb before dereferencing in amdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update This commit adds a null check for the afb variable in the amdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update function. Previously, afb was assumed to be null, but was used later in the code without a null check. This could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference. Fixes the below drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm_plane.c1298 amdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update() error we previously assumed afb could be null (see line 1252)",
