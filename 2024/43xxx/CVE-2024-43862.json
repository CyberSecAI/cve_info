    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net wan fsl_qmc_hdlc Convert carrier_lock spinlock to a mutex The carrier_lock spinlock protects the carrier detection. While it is held, framer_get_status() is called which in turn takes a mutex. This is not correct and can lead to a deadlock.
