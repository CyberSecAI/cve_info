    "description": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (Command Injection) vulnerability allows OS Command Injection as root This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC model chargers before version 24120701 Likelihood Moderate The binary does not seem to be used by the web interface, so it might be more difficult to find. It seems to be largely the same binary as used by the Iocharger Pedestal charging station, however. The attacker will also need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the binary, or convince a user with such access to execute a crafted HTTP request. Impact Critical The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and delete files and services.",
