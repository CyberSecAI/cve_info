    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media v4l async Fix NULL pointer dereference in adding ancillary links In v4l2_async_create_ancillary_links(), ancillary links are created for lens and flash sub-devices. These are sub-device to sub-device links and if the async notifier is related to a V4L2 device, the source sub-device of the ancillary link is NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. Check the notifiers sd field is non-NULL in v4l2_async_create_ancillary_links(). [Sakari Ailus Reword the subject and commit messages slightly.]",
