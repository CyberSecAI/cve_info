    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoc PCM6240 Return directly after a failed devm_kzalloc() in pcmdevice_i2c_probe() The value -ENOMEM was assigned to the local variable ret in one if branch after a devm_kzalloc() call failed at the beginning. This error code will trigger then a pcmdevice_remove() call with a passed null pointer so that an undesirable dereference will be performed. Thus return the appropriate error code directly.",
