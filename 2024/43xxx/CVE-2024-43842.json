    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi rtw89 Fix array index mistake in rtw89_sta_info_get_iter() In rtw89_sta_info_get_iter() status->he_gi is compared to array size. But then rate->he_gi is used as array index instead of status->he_gi. This can lead to go beyond array boundaries in case of rate->he_gi is not equal to status->he_gi and is bigger than array size. Looks like copy-paste mistake. Fix this mistake by replacing rate->he_gi with status->he_gi. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
