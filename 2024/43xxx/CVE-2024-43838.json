  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf fix overflow check in adjust_jmp_off() adjust_jmp_off() incorrectly used the insn->imm field for all overflow check, which is incorrect as that should only be done or the BPF_JMP32 | BPF_JA case, not the general jump instruction case. Fix it by using insn->off for overflow check in the general case.",
