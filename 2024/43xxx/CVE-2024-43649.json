    "description": "Authenticated command injection in the filename of a .exe request leads to remote code execution as the root user. This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701. Likelihood Moderate This action is not a common place for command injection vulnerabilities to occur. Thus, an attacker will likely only be able to find this vulnerability by reverse-engineering the firmware or trying it on all fields. The attacker will also need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the binary, or convince a user with such access to execute a payload. Impact Critical The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and delete files and services. CVSS clarification This attack can be performed over any network conenction serving the web interfacr (AVN), and there are not additional mitigating measures that need to be circumvented (ACL) or other prerequisites (ATN). The attack does require privileges, but the level does not matter (PRL), there is no user interaction required (UIN). The attack leeds to a full compromised of the charger (VCH/VIH/VAH) and a compromised charger can be used to pivot to networks that should normally not be reachable (SCL/SIL/SAH). Because this is an EV chargers with significant pwoer, there is a potential safety imp0act (SP). THis attack can be automated (AUY).",
