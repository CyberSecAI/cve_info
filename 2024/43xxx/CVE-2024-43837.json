    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Fix null pointer dereference in resolve_prog_type() for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT When loading a EXT program without specifying `attr->attach_prog_fd`, the `prog->aux->dst_prog` will be null. At this time, calling resolve_prog_type() anywhere will result in a null pointer dereference.
