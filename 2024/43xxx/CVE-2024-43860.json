    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved remoteproc imx_rproc Skip over memory region when node value is NULL In imx_rproc_addr_init() nph = of_count_phandle_with_args() just counts number of phandles. But phandles may be empty. So of_parse_phandle() in the parsing loop (0 < a < nph) may return NULL which is later dereferenced. Adjust this issue by adding NULL-return check. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE. [Fixed title to fit within the prescribed 70-75 charcters]",
