    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media pci ivtv Add check for DMA map result In case DMA fails, dma->SG_length is 0. This value is later used to access dma->SGarray[dma->SG_length - 1], which will cause out of bounds access. Add check to return early on invalid value. Adjust warnings accordingly. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
