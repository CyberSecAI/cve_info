    "description": "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Cinder through 24.0.0, Glance before 28.0.2, and Nova before 29.0.3. Arbitrary file access can occur via custom QCOW2 external data. By supplying a crafted QCOW2 image that references a specific data file path, an authenticated user may convince systems to return a copy of that files contents from the server, resulting in unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data. All Cinder and Nova deployments are affected only Glance deployments with image conversion enabled are affected.",
