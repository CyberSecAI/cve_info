    "description": "Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Prior to 24.4.1, when authenticating as a superuser to Sentry with a username and password, the password is leaked as cleartext in logs under the _event_ `auth-index.validate_superuser`. An attacker with access to the log data could use these leaked credentials to login to the Sentry system as superuser. Self-hosted users on affected versions should upgrade to 24.4.1 or later. Users can configure the logging level to exclude logs of the `INFO` level and only generate logs for levels at `WARNING` or more.",
