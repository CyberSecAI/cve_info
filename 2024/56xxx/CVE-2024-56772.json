  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved kunit string-stream Fix a UAF bug in kunit_init_suite() In kunit_debugfs_create_suite(), if alloc_string_stream() fails in the kunit_suite_for_each_test_case() loop, the suite->log = stream has assigned before, and the error path only free the suite->logs stream memory but not set it to NULL, so the later string_stream_clear() of suite->log in kunit_init_suite() will cause below UAF bug. Set stream pointer to NULL after free to fix it.
