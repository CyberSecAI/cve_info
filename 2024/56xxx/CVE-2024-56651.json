  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved can hi311x hi3110_can_ist() fix potential use-after-free The commit a22bd630cfff (can hi311x do not report txerr and rxerr during bus-off) removed the reporting of rxerr and txerr even in case of correct operation (i. e. not bus-off). The error count information added to the CAN frame after netif_rx() is a potential use after free, since there is no guarantee that the skb is in the same state. It might be freed or reused. Fix the issue by postponing the netif_rx() call in case of txerr and rxerr reporting.",
