    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved PCI Fix reset_method_store() memory leak In reset_method_store(), a string is allocated via kstrndup() and assigned to the local options. options is then used in with strsep() to find spaces while ((name = strsep(&options, )) != NULL) { If there are no remaining spaces, then options is set to NULL by strsep(), so the subsequent kfree(options) doesnt free the memory allocated via kstrndup(). Fix by using a separate tmp_options to iterate with strsep() so options is preserved.",
