    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved powerpc/pseries/vas Add close() callback in vas_vm_ops struct The mapping VMA address is saved in VAS window struct when the paste address is mapped. This VMA address is used during migration to unmap the paste address if the window is active. The paste address mapping will be removed when the window is closed or with the munmap(). But the VMA address in the VAS window is not updated with munmap() which is causing invalid access during migration. The KASAN report shows",
