    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved powerpc/prom_init Fixup missing powermac #size-cells On some powermacs `escc` nodes are missing `#size-cells` properties, which is deprecated and now triggers a warning at boot since commit 045b14ca5c36 (of WARN on deprecated #address-cells/#size-cells handling). For example Missing #size-cells in /pci@f2000000/mac-io@c/escc@13000 WARNING CPU 0 PID 0 at drivers/of/base.c133 of_bus_n_size_cells+0x98/0x108 Hardware name PowerMac3,1 7400 0xc0209 PowerMac ...

Note that `escc-legacy` nodes are also missing `#size-cells` properties, but they are skipped by the macio driver, so leave them alone.
