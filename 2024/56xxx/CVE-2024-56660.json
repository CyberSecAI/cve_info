    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/mlx5 DR, prevent potential error pointer dereference The dr_domain_add_vport_cap() function generally returns NULL on error but sometimes we want it to return ERR_PTR(-EBUSY) so the caller can retry. The problem here is that ret can be either -EBUSY or -ENOMEM and if its and -ENOMEM then the error pointer is propogated back and eventually dereferenced in dr_ste_v0_build_src_gvmi_qpn_tag().",
