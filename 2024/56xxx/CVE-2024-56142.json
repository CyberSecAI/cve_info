    "description": "pghoard is a PostgreSQL backup daemon and restore tooling that stores backup data in cloud object stores. A vulnerability has been discovered that could allow an attacker to acquire disk access with privileges equivalent to those of pghoard, allowing for unintended path traversal. Depending on the permissions/privileges assigned to pghoard, this could allow disclosure of sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in releases after 2.2.2a. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
