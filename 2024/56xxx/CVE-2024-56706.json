    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved s390/cpum_sf Fix and protect memory allocation of SDBs with mutex Reservation of the PMU hardware is done at first event creation and is protected by a pair of mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock(). After reservation of the PMU hardware the memory required for the PMUs the event is to be installed on is allocated by allocate_buffers() and alloc_sampling_buffer(). This done outside of the mutex protection. Without mutex protection two or more concurrent invocations of perf_event_init() may run in parallel. This can lead to allocation of Sample Data Blocks (SDBs) multiple times for the same PMU. Prevent this and protect memory allocation of SDBs by mutex.",
