    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved cacheinfo Allocate memory during CPU hotplug if not done from the primary CPU Commit 5944ce092b97 (arch_topology Build cacheinfo from primary CPU) adds functionality that architectures can use to optionally allocate and build cacheinfo early during boot. Commit 6539cffa9495 (cacheinfo Add arch specific early level initializer) lets secondary CPUs correct (and reallocate memory) cacheinfo data if needed. If the early build functionality is not used and cacheinfo does not need correction, memory for cacheinfo is never allocated. x86 does not use the early build functionality. Consequently, during the cacheinfo CPU hotplug callback, last_level_cache_is_valid() attempts to dereference a NULL pointer",
