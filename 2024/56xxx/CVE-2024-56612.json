    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/gup handle NULL pages in unpin_user_pages() The recent addition of pofs (pages or folios) handling to gup has a flaw it assumes that unpin_user_pages() handles NULL pages in the pages** array. Thats not the case, as I discovered when I ran on a new configuration on my test machine. Fix this by skipping NULL pages in unpin_user_pages(), just like unpin_folios() already does. Details when booting on x86 with numa=fake=2 movablecore=4G on Linux 6.12, and running this tools/testing/selftests/mm/gup_longterm ...I get the following crash",
