    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved EDAC/igen6 Avoid segmentation fault on module unload The segmentation fault happens because During modprobe 1. In igen6_probe(), igen6_pvt will be allocated with kzalloc() 2. In igen6_register_mci(), mci->pvt_info will point to &igen6_pvt->imc[mc] During rmmod 1. In mci_release() in edac_mc.c, it will kfree(mci->pvt_info) 2. In igen6_remove(), it will kfree(igen6_pvt) Fix this issue by setting mci->pvt_info to NULL to avoid the double kfree.",
