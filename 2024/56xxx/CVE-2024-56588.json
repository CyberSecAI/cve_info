    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi hisi_sas Create all dump files during debugfs initialization For the current debugfs of hisi_sas, after user triggers dump, the driver allocate memory space to save the register information and create debugfs files to display the saved information. In this process, the debugfs files created after each dump. Therefore, when the dump is triggered while the driver is unbind, the following hang occurs",
