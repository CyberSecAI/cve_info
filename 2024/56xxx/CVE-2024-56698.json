    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb dwc3 gadget Fix looping of queued SG entries The dwc3_request->num_queued_sgs is decremented on completion. If a partially completed request is handled, then the dwc3_request->num_queued_sgs no longer reflects the total number of num_queued_sgs (it would be cleared). Correctly check the number of request SG entries remained to be prepare and queued. Failure to do this may cause null pointer dereference when accessing non-existent SG entry.",
