    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amdgpu Fix the memory allocation issue in amdgpu_discovery_get_nps_info() Fix two issues with memory allocation in amdgpu_discovery_get_nps_info() for mem_ranges - Add a check for allocation failure to avoid dereferencing a null pointer. - As suggested by Christophe, use kvcalloc() for memory allocation, which checks for multiplication overflow. Additionally, assign the output parameters nps_type and range_cnt after the kvcalloc() call to prevent modifying the output parameters in case of an error return.",
