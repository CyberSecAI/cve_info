  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iommu/vt-d Fix qi_batch NULL pointer with nested parent domain The qi_batch is allocated when assigning cache tag for a domain. While for nested parent domain, it is missed. Hence, when trying to map pages to the nested parent, NULL dereference occurred. Also, there is potential memleak since there is no lock around domain->qi_batch allocation. To solve it, add a helper for qi_batch allocation, and call it in both the __cache_tag_assign_domain() and __cache_tag_assign_parent_domain().",
