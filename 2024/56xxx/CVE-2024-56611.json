  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/mempolicy fix migrate_to_node() assuming there is at least one VMA in a MM We currently assume that there is at least one VMA in a MM, which isnt true. So we might end up having find_vma() return NULL, to then de-reference NULL. So properly handle find_vma() returning NULL.
