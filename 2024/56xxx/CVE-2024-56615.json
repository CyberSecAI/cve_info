    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf fix OOB devmap writes when deleting elements Jordy reported issue against XSKMAP which also applies to DEVMAP - the index used for accessing map entry, due to being a signed integer, causes the OOB writes. Fix is simple as changing the type from int to u32, however, when compared to XSKMAP case, one more thing needs to be addressed. When map is released from system via dev_map_free(), we iterate through all of the entries and an iterator variable is also an int, which implies OOB accesses. Again, change it to be u32.
