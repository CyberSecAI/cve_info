    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs check folio mapping after unlock in relocate_one_folio() When we call btrfs_read_folio() to bring a folio uptodate, we unlock the folio. The result of that is that a different thread can modify the mapping (like remove it with invalidate) before we call folio_lock(). This results in an invalid page and we need to try again. In particular, if we are relocating concurrently with aborting a transaction, this can result in a crash like the following",
