    "description": "The FooGallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via image attachment fields (such as Title, Alt Text, Custom URL, Custom Class, and Override Type) in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.14 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
