  "description": "A path traversal vulnerability in the /apply_settings endpoint of parisneo/lollms-webui allows attackers to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the configuration settings, specifically within the extensions parameter. Attackers can exploit this by crafting a payload that includes relative path traversal sequences (../../../), enabling them to navigate to arbitrary directories. This flaw subsequently allows the server to load and execute a malicious __init__.py file, leading to remote code execution. The issue affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui.",
