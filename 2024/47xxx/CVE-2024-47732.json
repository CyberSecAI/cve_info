    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved crypto iaa - Fix potential use after free bug The free_device_compression_mode(iaa_device, device_mode) function frees device_mode but it iss passed to iaa_compression_modes[i]->free() a few lines later resulting in a use after free. The good news is that, so far as I can tell, nothing implements the ->free() function and the use after free happens in dead code. But, with this fix, when something does implement it, well be ready. )",
