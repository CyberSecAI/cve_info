    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe Use reserved copy engine for user binds on faulting devices User binds map to engines with can fault, faults depend on user binds completion, thus we can deadlock. Avoid this by using reserved copy engine for user binds on faulting devices. While we are here, normalize bind queue creation with a helper. v2 - Pass in extensions to bind queue creation (CI) v3 - s/resevered/reserved (Lucas) - Fix NULL hwe check (Jonathan)",
