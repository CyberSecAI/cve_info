    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved spi hisi-kunpeng Add verification for the max_frequency provided by the firmware If the value of max_speed_hz is 0, it may cause a division by zero error in hisi_calc_effective_speed(). The value of max_speed_hz is provided by firmware. Firmware is generally considered as a trusted domain. However, as division by zero errors can cause system failure, for defense measure, the value of max_speed is validated here. So 0 is regarded as invalid and an error code is returned.",
