It fails to validate the mail parameter of the createAction, resulting in Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in some configurations. An unauthenticated attacker can use this to display user-submitted data of all forms persisted by the extension. The fixed versions are 7.5.1, 8.5.1, 10.9.1, and 12.4.1.",
