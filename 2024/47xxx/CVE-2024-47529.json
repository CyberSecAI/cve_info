    "description": "OpenC3 COSMOS provides the functionality needed to send commands to and receive data from one or more embedded systems. OpenC3 COSMOS stores the password of a user unencrypted in the LocalStorage of a web browser. This makes the user password susceptible to exfiltration via Cross-site scripting (see GHSL-2024-128). This vulnerability is fixed in 5.19.0. This only affects Open Source edition, and not OpenC3 COSMOS Enterprise Edition.",
