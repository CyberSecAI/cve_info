    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved PCI kirin Fix buffer overflow in kirin_pcie_parse_port() Within kirin_pcie_parse_port(), the pcie->num_slots is compared to pcie->gpio_id_reset size (MAX_PCI_SLOTS) which is correct and would lead to an overflow. Thus, fix condition to pcie->num_slots + 1 >= MAX_PCI_SLOTS and move pcie->num_slots increment below the if-statement to avoid out-of-bounds array access. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE. [kwilczynski commit log]",
