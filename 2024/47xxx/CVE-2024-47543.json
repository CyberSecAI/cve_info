    "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been discovered in qtdemux_parse_container function within qtdemux.c. In the parent function qtdemux_parse_node, the value of length is not well checked. So, if length is big enough, it causes the pointer end to point beyond the boundaries of buffer. Subsequently, in the qtdemux_parse_container function, the while loop can trigger an OOB-read, accessing memory beyond the bounds of buf. This vulnerability can result in reading up to 4GB of process memory or potentially causing a segmentation fault (SEGV) when accessing invalid memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
