    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved staging iio frequency ad9834 Validate frequency parameter value In ad9834_write_frequency() clk_get_rate() can return 0. In such case ad9834_calc_freqreg() call will lead to division by zero. Checking if (fout > (clk_freq / 2)) doesnt protect in case of fout is 0. ad9834_write_frequency() is called from ad9834_write(), where fout is taken from text buffer, which can contain any value. Modify parameters checking. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
