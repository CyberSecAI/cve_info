    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/hugetlb.c fix UAF of vma in hugetlb fault pathway Syzbot reports a UAF in hugetlb_fault(). This happens because vmf_anon_prepare() could drop the per-VMA lock and allow the current VMA to be freed before hugetlb_vma_unlock_read() is called. We can fix this by using a modified version of vmf_anon_prepare() that doesnt release the VMA lock on failure, and then release it ourselves after hugetlb_vma_unlock_read().",
