    "description": "WikiDiscover is an extension designed for use with a CreateWiki managed farm to display wikis. SpecialWikiDiscover is a special page that lists all wikis on the wiki farm. However, the special page does not make any effort to escape the wiki name or description. Therefore, if a wiki sets its name and/or description to an XSS payload, the XSS will execute whenever the wiki is shown on SpecialWikiDiscover. This issue has been patched with commit `2ce846dd93` and all users are advised to apply that patch. User unable to upgrade should block access to `SpecialWikiDiscover`.",
