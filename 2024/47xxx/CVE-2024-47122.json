    "description": "In the goTenna Pro App, the encryption keys are stored along with a static IV on the End User Device (EUD). This allows for complete decryption of keys stored on the EUD if physically compromised. This allows an attacker to decrypt all encrypted broadcast communications based on encryption keys stored on the EUD. This requires access to and control of the EUD, so it is recommended to use strong access control measures and layered encryption on the EUD for more secure operation.",
