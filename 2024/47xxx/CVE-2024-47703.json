    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf, lsm Add check for BPF LSM return value A bpf prog returning a positive number attached to file_alloc_security hook makes kernel panic. This happens because file system can not filter out the positive number returned by the LSM prog using IS_ERR, and misinterprets this positive number as a file pointer. Given that hook file_alloc_security never returned positive number before the introduction of BPF LSM, and other BPF LSM hooks may encounter similar issues, this patch adds LSM return value check in verifier, to ensure no unexpected value is returned.",
