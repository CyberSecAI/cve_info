    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in InterMesh 7177 Hybrid 2.0 Subscriber (All versions < V8.2.12), InterMesh 7707 Fire Subscriber (All versions < V7.2.12 only if the IP interface is enabled (which is not the default configuration)). The web server of affected devices does not sanitize the input parameters in specific GET requests that allow for code execution on operating system level. In combination with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-47902, CVE-2024-47903, CVE-2024-47904) this could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.",
