This vulnerability could be exploited by unauthenticated users to enumerate valid usernames. User Enumeration via Timing Attack A user enumeration vulnerability exists in the Forget your password functionality. Differences in response times for existing and non-existing users, combined with a lack of request limiting, allow an attacker to determine the existence of usernames through a timing-based attack. MitigationPlease update to a version that addresses this timing vulnerability, where password reset responses are normalized to respond at the same time regardless of user existence.",
