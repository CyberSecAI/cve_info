  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drivers/perf Fix ali_drw_pmu driver interrupt status clearing The alibaba_uncore_pmu driver forgot to clear all interrupt status in the interrupt processing function. After the PMU counter overflow interrupt occurred, an interrupt storm occurred, causing the system to hang. Therefore, clear the correct interrupt status in the interrupt handling function to fix it.",
