    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved lib/generic-radix-tree.c Fix rare race in __genradix_ptr_alloc() If we need to increase the tree depth, allocate a new node, and then race with another thread that increased the tree depth before us, well still have a preallocated node that might be used later. If we then use that node for a new non-root node, itll still have a pointer to the old root instead of being zeroed - fix this by zeroing it in the cmpxchg failure path.",
