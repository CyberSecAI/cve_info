    "description": "go-tuf is a Go implementation of The Update Framework (TUF). The go-tuf client inconsistently traces the delegations. For example, if targets delegate to A, and to B, and B delegates to C, then the client should trace the delegations in the order A then B then C but it may incorrectly trace the delegations B->C->A. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.0.1.",
