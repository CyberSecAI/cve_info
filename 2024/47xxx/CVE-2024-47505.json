    "description": "An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in the PFE management daemon (evo-pfemand) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an authenticated, network-based attacker to cause an FPC crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).When specific SNMP GET operations or specific low-priviledged CLI commands are executed, a GUID resource leak will occur, eventually leading to exhaustion and resulting in FPCs to hang. Affected FPCs need to be manually restarted to recover. GUID exhaustion will trigger a syslog message like one of the following evo-pfemand[] get_next_guid Ran out of Guid Space ... evo-aftmand-zx[] get_next_guid Ran out of Guid Space ... The leak can be monitored by running the following command and taking note of the values in the rightmost column labeled Guids user@host> show platform application-info allocations app evo-pfemand/evo-pfemand In case one or more of these values are constantly increasing the leak is happening. This issue affects Junos OS Evolved * All versions before 21.4R3-S7-EVO, * 22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S6-EVO, * 22.2 versions before 22.2R3-EVO, * 22.3 versions before 22.3R3-EVO, * 22.4 versions before 22.4R2-EVO. Please note that this issue is similar to, but different from CVE-2024-47508 and CVE-2024-47509.",
