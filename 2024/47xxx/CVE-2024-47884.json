    "description": "foxmarks is a CLI read-only interface for Firefoxs bookmarks and history. A temporary file was created under the /tmp directory with read permissions for all users containing a copy of Firefoxs database of bookmarks, history, input history, visits counter, use counter, view counter and more confidential information about the history of using Firefox. Permissions default to 0o600 for NamedTempFile. However, after copying the database, its permissions were copied with it resulting in an insecure file with 0x644 permissions. A malicious user is able to read the database when the targeted user executes foxmarks bookmarks or foxmarks history. This vulnerability is patched in v2.1.0.",
