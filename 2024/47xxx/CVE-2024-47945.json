    "description": "The devices are vulnerable to session hijacking due to insufficient entropy in its session ID generation algorithm. The session IDs are predictable, with only 32,768 possible values per user, which allows attackers to pre-generate valid session IDs, leading to unauthorized access to user sessions. This is not only due to the use of an (insecure) rand() function call but also because of missing initialization via srand(). As a result only the PIDs are effectively used as seed.",
