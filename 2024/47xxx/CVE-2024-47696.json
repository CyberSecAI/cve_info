    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/iwcm Fix WARNINGat_kernel/workqueue.c#check_flush_dependency In the commit aee2424246f9 (RDMA/iwcm Fix a use-after-free related to destroying CM IDs), the function flush_workqueue is invoked to flush the work queue iwcm_wq. But at that time, the work queue iwcm_wq was created via the function alloc_ordered_workqueue without the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM. Because the current process is trying to flush the whole iwcm_wq, if iwcm_wq doesnt have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, verify that the current process is not reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue which doesnt have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM as that can break forward-progress guarantee leading to a deadlock. The call trace is as below [ 125.350876][ T1430] Call Trace [ 125.356281][ T1430] [ 125.361285][ T1430] ? __warn (kernel/panic.c693) [ 125.367640][ T1430] ? check_flush_dependency (kernel/workqueue.c3706 (discriminator 9)) [ 125.375689][ T1430] ? report_bug (lib/bug.c180 lib/bug.c219) [ 125.382505][ T1430] ? handle_bug (arch/x86/kernel/traps.c239) [ 125.388987][ T1430] ? exc_invalid_op (arch/x86/kernel/traps.c260 (discriminator 1)) [ 125.395831][ T1430] ? asm_exc_invalid_op (arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h621) [ 125.403125][ T1430] ? check_flush_dependency (kernel/workqueue.c3706 (discriminator 9)) [ 125.410984][ T1430] ? check_flush_dependency (kernel/workqueue.c3706 (discriminator 9)) [ 125.418764][ T1430] __flush_workqueu"
