    "description": "Kirby is a content management system. The new link field introduced in Kirby 4 allows several different link types that each validate the entered link to the relevant URL format. It also includes a Custom link type for advanced use cases that dont fit any of the pre-defined link formats. As the Custom link type is meant to be flexible, it also allows the javascript URL scheme. In some use cases this can be intended, but it can also be misused by attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when a user or visitor clicks on a link that is generated from the contents of the link field. This vulnerability is patched in 4.1.1.",
