  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved crypto sun8i-ce - Fix use after free in unprepare sun8i_ce_cipher_unprepare should be called before crypto_finalize_skcipher_request, because client callbacks may immediately free memory, that isnt needed anymore. But it will be used by unprepare after free. Before removing prepare/unprepare callbacks it was handled by crypto engine in crypto_finalize_request. Usually that results in a pointer dereference problem during a in crypto selftest.
