    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Add replay NULL check in edp_set_replay_allow_active() In the first if statement, were checking if replay is NULL. But in the second if statement, were not checking if replay is NULL again before calling replay->funcs->replay_set_power_opt(). if (replay == NULL && force_static) return false ... if (link->replay_settings.replay_feature_enabled && replay->funcs->replay_set_power_opt) { replay->funcs->replay_set_power_opt(replay, *power_opts, panel_inst) link->replay_settings.replay_power_opt_active = *power_opts } If replay is NULL, this will cause a null pointer dereference. Fixes the below found by smatch drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/link/protocols/link_edp_panel_control.c895 edp_set_replay_allow_active() error we previously assumed replay could be null (see line 887)",
