    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amdgpu Fix potential out-of-bounds access in amdgpu_discovery_reg_base_init() The issue arises when the array adev->vcn.vcn_config is accessed before checking if the index adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst is within the bounds of the array. The fix involves moving the bounds check before the array access. This ensures that adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst is within the bounds of the array before it is used as an index. Fixes the below drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_discovery.c1289 amdgpu_discovery_reg_base_init() error testing array offset adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst after use.",
