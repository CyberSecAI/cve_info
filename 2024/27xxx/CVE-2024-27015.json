    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter flowtable incorrect pppoe tuple pppoe traffic reaching ingress path does not match the flowtable entry because the pppoe header is expected to be at the network header offset. This bug causes a mismatch in the flow table lookup, so pppoe packets enter the classical forwarding path.",
