    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm nv04 Fix out of bounds access When Output Resource (dcb->or) value is assigned in fabricate_dcb_output(), there may be out of bounds access to dac_users array in case dcb->or is zero because ffs(dcb->or) is used as index there. The or argument of fabricate_dcb_output() must be interpreted as a number of bit to set, not value. Utilize macros from enum nouveau_or in calls instead of hardcoding. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
