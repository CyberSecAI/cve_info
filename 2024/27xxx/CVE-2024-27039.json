    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved clk hisilicon hi3559a Fix an erroneous devm_kfree() p_clk is an array allocated just before the for loop for all clk that need to be registered. It is incremented at each loop iteration. If a clk_register() call fails, p_clk may point to something different from what should be freed. The best we can do, is to avoid this wrong release of memory.",
