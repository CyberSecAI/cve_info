    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media edia dvbdev fix a use-after-free In dvb_register_device, *pdvbdev is set equal to dvbdev, which is freed in several error-handling paths. However, *pdvbdev is not set to NULL after dvbdevs deallocation, causing use-after-frees in many places, for example, in the following call chain budget_register |-> dvb_dmxdev_init |-> dvb_register_device |-> dvb_dmxdev_release |-> dvb_unregister_device |-> dvb_remove_device |-> dvb_device_put |-> kref_put When calling dvb_unregister_device, dmxdev->dvbdev (i.e. *pdvbdev in dvb_register_device) could point to memory that had been freed in dvb_register_device. Thereafter, this pointer is transferred to kref_put and triggering a use-after-free.",
