    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display fix NULL checks for adev->dm.dc in amdgpu_dm_fini() Since adev->dm.dc in amdgpu_dm_fini() might turn out to be NULL before the call to dc_enable_dmub_notifications(), check beforehand to ensure there will not be a possible NULL-ptr-deref there. Also, since commit 1e88eb1b2c25 (drm/amd/display Drop CONFIG_DRM_AMD_DC_HDCP) there are two separate checks for NULL in adev->dm.dc before dc_deinit_callbacks() and dc_dmub_srv_destroy(). Clean up by combining them all under one if. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static analysis tool SVACE.",
