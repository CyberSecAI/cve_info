    "description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting) vulnerability in Apache Archiva. This issue affects Apache Archiva from 2.0.0. As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users. Alternatively, you could configure a HTTP proxy in front of your Archiva instance to only forward requests that do not have malicious characters in the URL. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",
