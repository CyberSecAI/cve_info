    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Bluetooth l2cap fix null-ptr-deref in l2cap_chan_timeout There is a race condition between l2cap_chan_timeout() and l2cap_chan_del(). When we use l2cap_chan_del() to delete the channel, the chan->conn will be set to null. But the conn could be dereferenced again in the mutex_lock() of l2cap_chan_timeout(). As a result the null pointer dereference bug will happen. The KASAN report triggered by POC is shown below [ 472.074580] ================================================================== [ 472.075284] BUG KASAN null-ptr-deref in mutex_lock+0x68/0xc0 [ 472.075308] Write of size 8 at addr 0000000000000158 by task kworker/00/7 [ 472.075308] [ 472.075308] CPU 0 PID 7 Comm kworker/00 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc5-00356-g78c0094a146b #36 [ 472.075308] Hardware name QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.14.0-0-g155821a1990b-prebuilt.qemu4 [ 472.075308] Workqueue events l2cap_chan_timeout [ 472.075308] Call Trace [ 472.075308] [ 472.075308] dump_stack_lvl+0x137/0x1a0 [ 472.075308] print_report+0x101/0x250 [ 472.075308] ? __virt_addr_valid+0x77/0x160 [ 472.075308] ? mutex_lock+0x68/0xc0 [ 472.075308] kasan_report+0x139/0x170 [ 472.075308] ? mutex_lock+0x68/0xc0 [ 472.075308] kasan_check_range+0x2c3/0x2e0 [ 472.075308] mutex_lock+0x68/0xc0 [ 472.075308] l2cap_chan_timeout+0x181/0x300 [ 472.075308] process_one_work+0x5d2/0xe00 [ 472.075308] worker_thread+0xe"
