    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vfio/pci Disable auto-enable of exclusive INTx IRQ Currently for devices requiring masking at the irqchip for INTx, ie. devices without DisINTx support, the IRQ is enabled in request_irq() and subsequently disabled as necessary to align with the masked status flag. This presents a window where the interrupt could fire between these events, resulting in the IRQ incrementing the disable depth twice. This would be unrecoverable for a user since the masked flag prevents nested enables through vfio. Instead, invert the logic using IRQF_NO_AUTOEN such that exclusive INTx is never auto-enabled, then unmask as required.",
