    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi nl80211 reject iftype change with mesh ID change Its currently possible to change the mesh ID when the interface isnt yet in mesh mode, at the same time as changing it into mesh mode. This leads to an overwrite of data in the wdev->u union for the interface type it currently has, causing cfg80211_change_iface() to do wrong things when switching. We could probably allow setting an interface to mesh while setting the mesh ID at the same time by doing a different order of operations here, but realistically theres no userspace thats going to do this, so just disallow changes in iftype when setting mesh ID.",
