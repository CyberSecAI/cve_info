Prior to version 4.18.2, SQL injection can occur when all of the following conditions are met the non-default simple protocol is used a placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus there must be a second placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder both must be on the same line and both parameter values must be user-controlled.
