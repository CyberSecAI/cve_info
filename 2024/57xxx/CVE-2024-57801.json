    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/mlx5e Skip restore TC rules for vport rep without loaded flag During driver unload, unregister_netdev is called after unloading vport rep. So, the mlx5e_rep_priv is already freed while trying to get rpriv->netdev, or walk rpriv->tc_ht, which results in use-after-free. So add the checking to make sure access the data of vport rep which is still loaded.",
