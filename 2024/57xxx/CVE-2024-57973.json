    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved rdma/cxgb4 Prevent potential integer overflow on 32bit The gl->tot_len variable is controlled by the user. It comes from process_responses(). On 32bit systems, the gl->tot_len + sizeof(struct cpl_pass_accept_req) + sizeof(struct rss_header) addition could have an integer wrapping bug. Use size_add() to prevent this.",
