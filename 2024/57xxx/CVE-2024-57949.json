    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved irqchip/gic-v3-its Dont enable interrupts in its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity() The following call-chain leads to enabling interrupts in a nested interrupt disabled section irq_set_vcpu_affinity() irq_get_desc_lock() raw_spin_lock_irqsave() <--- Disable interrupts its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity() guard(raw_spinlock_irq) <--- Enables interrupts when leaving the guard() irq_put_desc_unlock() <--- Warns because interrupts are enabled This was broken in commit b97e8a2f7130, which replaced the original raw_spin_[un]lock() pair with guard(raw_spinlock_irq). Fix the issue by using guard(raw_spinlock). [ tglx Massaged change log ]",
