    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iio dummy iio_simply_dummy_buffer fix information leak in triggered buffer The data array is allocated via kmalloc() and it is used to push data to user space from a triggered buffer, but it does not set values for inactive channels, as it only uses iio_for_each_active_channel() to assign new values. Use kzalloc for the memory allocation to avoid pushing uninitialized information to userspace.",
