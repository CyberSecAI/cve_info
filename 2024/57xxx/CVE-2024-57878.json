    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved arm64 ptrace fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_FPMR Currently fpmr_set() doesnt initialize the temporary fpmr variable, and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave this uninitialized. Consequently an arbitrary value will be written back to target->thread.uw.fpmr, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from the kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack, and the issue does not provide a write mechanism. Fix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset from userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG, NT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing contents of FPMR will be retained.
