    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved power supply gpio-charger Fix set charge current limits Fix set charge current limits for devices which allow to set the lowest charge current limit to be greater zero. If requested charge current limit is below lowest limit, the index equals current_limit_map_size which leads to accessing memory beyond allocated memory.",
