    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved rtc tps6594 Fix integer overflow on 32bit systems The problem is this multiply in tps6594_rtc_set_offset() tmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR The tmp variable is an s64 but offset is a long in the (-277774)-277774 range. On 32bit systems a long can hold numbers up to approximately two billion. The number of TICKS_PER_HOUR is really large, (32768 * 3600) or roughly a hundred million. When you start multiplying by a hundred million it doesnt take long to overflow the two billion mark. Probably the safest way to fix this is to change the type of TICKS_PER_HOUR to long long because its such a large number.",
