    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved powerpc/pseries/iommu IOMMU incorrectly marks MMIO range in DDW Power Hypervisor can possibily allocate MMIO window intersecting with Dynamic DMA Window (DDW) range, which is over 32-bit addressing. These MMIO pages needs to be marked as reserved so that IOMMU doesnt map DMA buffers in this range. The current code is not marking these pages correctly which is resulting in LPAR to OOPS while booting. The stack is at below BUG Unable to handle kernel data access on read at 0xc00800005cd40000 Faulting instruction address 0xc00000000005cdac Oops Kernel access of bad area, sig 11",
