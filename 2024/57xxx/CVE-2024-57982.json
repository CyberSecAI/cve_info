    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved xfrm state fix out-of-bounds read during lookup lookup and resize can run in parallel. The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock ensures a retry, but the hash functions can observe a hmask value that is too large for the new hlist array. rehash does rcu_assign_pointer(net->xfrm.state_bydst, ndst) [..] net->xfrm.state_hmask = nhashmask While state lookup does h = xfrm_dst_hash(net, daddr, saddr, tmpl->reqid, encap_family) hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(x, net->xfrm.state_bydst + h, bydst) { This is only safe in case the update to state_bydst is larger than net->xfrm.xfrm_state_hmask (or if the lookup function gets serialized via state spinlock again). Fix this by prefetching state_hmask and the associated pointers. The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock retry will ensure that the pointer and the hmask will be consistent. The existing helpers, like xfrm_dst_hash(), are now unsafe for RCU side, add lockdep assertions to document that they are only safe for insert side. xfrm_state_lookup_byaddr() uses the spinlock rather than RCU. AFAICS this is an oversight from back when state lookup was converted to RCU, this lock should be replaced with RCU in a future patch.",
