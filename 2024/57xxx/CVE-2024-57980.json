    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media uvcvideo Fix double free in error path If the uvc_status_init() function fails to allocate the int_urb, it will free the dev->status pointer but doesnt reset the pointer to NULL. This results in the kfree() call in uvc_status_cleanup() trying to double-free the memory. Fix it by resetting the dev->status pointer to NULL after freeing it. Reviewed by Ricardo Ribalda",
