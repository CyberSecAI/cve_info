    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/uverbs Prevent integer overflow issue In the expression cmd.wqe_size * cmd.wr_count, both variables are u32 values that come from the user so the multiplication can lead to integer wrapping. Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which also could potentially wrap. The cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge) multiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although its fine on 64bit systems. This patch does two things. First, Ive re-arranged the condition in uverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable len is on one side of the comparison by itself without any math. Then Ive modified all the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications.",
