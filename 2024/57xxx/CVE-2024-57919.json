  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display fix divide error in DM plane scale calcs dm_get_plane_scale doesnt take into account plane scaled size equal to zero, leading to a kernel oops due to division by zero. Fix by setting out-scale size as zero when the dst size is zero, similar to what is done by drm_calc_scale(). This issue started with the introduction of cursor ovelay mode that uses this function to assess cursor mode changes via dm_crtc_get_cursor_mode() before checking plane state.
