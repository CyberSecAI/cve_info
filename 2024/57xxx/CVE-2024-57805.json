    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC SOF Intel hda-dai Do not release the link DMA on STOP The linkDMA should not be released on stop trigger since a stream re-start might happen without closing of the stream. This leaves a short time for other streams to steal the linkDMA since it has been released. This issue is not easy to reproduce under normal conditions as usually after stop the stream is closed, or the same stream is restarted, but if another stream got in between the stop and start, like this aplay -Dhw0,3 -c2 -r48000 -fS32_LE /dev/zero -d 120 CTRL+z aplay -Dhw0,0 -c2 -r48000 -fS32_LE /dev/zero -d 120 then the link DMA channels will be mixed up, resulting firmware error or crash.",
