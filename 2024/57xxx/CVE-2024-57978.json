    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media imx-jpeg Fix potential error pointer dereference in detach_pm() The proble is on the first line if (jpeg->pd_dev[i] && !pm_runtime_suspended(jpeg->pd_dev[i])) If jpeg->pd_dev[i] is an error pointer, then passing it to pm_runtime_suspended() will lead to an Oops. The other conditions check for both error pointers and NULL, but it would be more clear to use the IS_ERR_OR_NULL() check for that.",
