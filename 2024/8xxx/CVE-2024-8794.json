    "description": "The BA Book Everything plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary password reset in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.20. This is due to the reset_user_password() function not verifying a users identity prior to setting a password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset any users passwords, including administrators. Its important to note that the attacker will not have access to the generated password, therefore, privilege escalation is not possible.",
