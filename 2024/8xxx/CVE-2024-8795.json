    "description": "The BA Book Everything plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.20. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the my_account_update() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update a users account details via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to reset a users password and gain access to their account.",
