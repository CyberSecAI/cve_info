  "description": "Concrete CMS versions 9.0.0 through 9.3.3 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability in the Top Navigator Bar block. Since the Top Navigator Bar output was not sufficiently sanitized, a rogue administrator could add a malicious payload that could be executed when targeted users visited the home page.The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v4 score of 4.6 with vector CVSS4.0/AVN/ACL/ATN/PRH/UIA/VCN/VIL/VAN/SCN/SIN/SAN https//www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS4.0/AVN/ACL/ATN/PRH/UIA/VCN/VIL/VAN/SCN/SIN/SAN . This does not affect versions below 9.0.0 since they do not have the Top Navigator Bar Block. Thanks, Chu Quoc Khanh for reporting.",
