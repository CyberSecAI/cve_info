    "description": "A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.2.2 allows for Prisma injection. The issue exists in the API endpoint /embed/embedId/stream-chat where user-provided JSON is directly taken to the Prisma librarys where clause. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted JSON object, such as {sessionId{nota}}, causing Prisma to return all data from the table. This can lead to unauthorized access to all user queries in embedded chat mode.",
