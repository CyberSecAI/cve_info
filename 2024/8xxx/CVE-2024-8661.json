The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v4 score of 4.6 with vector CVSS4.0/AVN/ACL/ATN/PRH/UIA/VCN/VIL/VAN/SCN/SIN/SAN https//www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS4.0/AVN/ACL/ATN/PRH/UIA/VCN/VIL/VAN/SCN/SIN/SAN Since the Next&Previous Nav block output was not sufficiently sanitized, the malicious payload could be executed in the browsers of targeted users.
