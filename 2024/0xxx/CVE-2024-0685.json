    "description": "The Ninja Forms Contact Form - The Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Second Order SQL Injection via the email address value submitted through forms in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject SQL in their email address that will append additional into the already existing query when an administrator triggers a personal data export.",
