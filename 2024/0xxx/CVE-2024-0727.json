    "description": "Issue summary Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSLto crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attackImpact summary Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrustedsources might terminate abruptly.A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from anuntrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, butOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointerdereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application willbe vulnerable to this issue.OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are PKCS12_parse(),PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()and PKCS12_newpass().We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since thisfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.",
