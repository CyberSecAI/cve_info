    "description": "A mass assignment vulnerability exists in the `/api/invite/code` endpoint of the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, allowing unauthorized creation of high-privileged accounts. By intercepting and modifying the HTTP request during the account creation process via an invitation link, an attacker can add a `role` property with `admin` value, thereby gaining administrative access. This issue arises due to the lack of property allowlisting and blocklisting, enabling the attacker to exploit the system and perform actions as an administrator.",
