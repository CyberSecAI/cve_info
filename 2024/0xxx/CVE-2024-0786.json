    "description": "The Conversios - Google Analytics 4 (GA4), Meta Pixel & more Via Google Tag Manager For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the ee_syncProductCategory function using the parameters conditionData, valueData, productArray, exclude and include in all versions up to, and including, 6.9.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",
