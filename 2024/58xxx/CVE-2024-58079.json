    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media uvcvideo Fix crash during unbind if gpio unit is in use We used the wrong device for the device managed functions. We used the usb device, when we should be using the interface device. If we unbind the driver from the usb interface, the cleanup functions are never called. In our case, the IRQ is never disabled. If an IRQ is triggered, it will try to access memory sections that are already free, causing an OOPS. We cannot use the function devm_request_threaded_irq here. The devm_* clean functions may be called after the main structure is released by uvc_delete. Luckily this bug has small impact, as it is only affected by devices with gpio units and the user has to unbind the device, a disconnect will not trigger this error.",
