    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi ath11k fix RCU stall while reaping monitor destination ring While processing the monitor destination ring, MSDUs are reaped from the link descriptor based on the corresponding buf_id. However, sometimes the driver cannot obtain a valid buffer corresponding to the buf_id received from the hardware. This causes an infinite loop in the destination processing, resulting in a kernel crash. kernel log ath11k_pci 00005800.0 data msdu_pop invalid buf_id 309 ath11k_pci 00005800.0 data dp_rx_monitor_link_desc_return failed ath11k_pci 00005800.0 data msdu_pop invalid buf_id 309 ath11k_pci 00005800.0 data dp_rx_monitor_link_desc_return failed Fix this by skipping the problematic buf_id and reaping the next entry, replacing the break with the next MSDU processing.
