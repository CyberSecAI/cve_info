    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media i2c ds90ub9x3 Fix extra fwnode_handle_put() The ub913 and ub953 drivers call fwnode_handle_put(priv->sd.fwnode) as part of their remove process, and if the driver is removed multiple times, eventually leads to put overflow, possibly causing memory corruption or crash. The fwnode_handle_put() is a leftover from commit 905f88ccebb1 (media i2c ds90ub9x3 Fix sub-device matching), which changed the code related to the sd.fwnode, but missed removing these fwnode_handle_put() calls.",
