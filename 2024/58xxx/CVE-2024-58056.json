    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved remoteproc core Fix ida_free call while not allocated In the rproc_alloc() function, on error, put_device(&rproc->dev) is called, leading to the call of the rproc_type_release() function. An error can occurs before ida_alloc is called. In such case in rproc_type_release(), the condition (rproc->index >= 0) is true as rproc->index has been initialized to 0. ida_free() is called reporting a warning [ 4.181906] WARNING CPU 1 PID 24 at lib/idr.c525 ida_free+0x100/0x164 [ 4.186378] stm32-display-dsi 5a000000.dsi Fixed dependency cycle(s) with /soc/dsi@5a000000/panel@0 [ 4.188854] ida_free called for id=0 which is not allocated.
