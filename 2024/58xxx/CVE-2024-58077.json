    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC soc-pcm dont use soc_pcm_ret() on .prepare callback commit 1f5664351410 (ASoC lower no backend DAIs enabled for ... Port log severity) ignores -EINVAL error message on common soc_pcm_ret(). It is used from many functions, ignoring -EINVAL is over-kill. The reason why -EINVAL was ignored was it really should only be used upon invalid parameters coming from userspace and in that case we dont want to log an error since we do not want to give userspace a way to do a denial-of-service attack on the syslog / diskspace. So dont use soc_pcm_ret() on .prepare callback is better idea.",
