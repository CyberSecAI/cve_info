    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved binfmt_flat Fix integer overflow bug on 32 bit systems Most of these sizes and counts are capped at 256MB so the math doesnt result in an integer overflow. The relocs count needs to be checked as well. Otherwise on 32bit systems the calculation of full_data could be wrong. full_data = data_len + relocs * sizeof(unsigned long)",
