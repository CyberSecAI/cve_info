    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC SOF Intel hda-dai Ensure DAI widget is valid during params Each cpu DAI should associate with a widget. However, the topology might not create the right number of DAI widgets for aggregated amps. And it will cause NULL pointer deference. Check that the DAI widget associated with the CPU DAI is valid to prevent NULL pointer deference due to missing DAI widgets in topologies with aggregated amps.",
