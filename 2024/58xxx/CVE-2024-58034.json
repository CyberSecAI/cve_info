    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved memory tegra20-emc fix an OF node reference bug in tegra_emc_find_node_by_ram_code() As of_find_node_by_name() release the reference of the argument device node, tegra_emc_find_node_by_ram_code() releases some device nodes while still in use, resulting in possible UAFs. According to the bindings and the in-tree DTS files, the emc-tables node is always devices child node with the property nvidia,use-ram-code, and the lpddr2 node is a child of the emc-tables node. Thus utilize the for_each_child_of_node() macro and of_get_child_by_name() instead of of_find_node_by_name() to simplify the code. This bug was found by an experimental verification tool that I am developing. [krzysztof applied v1, adjust the commit msg to incorporate v2 parts]",
