    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved rtc pcf85063 fix potential OOB write in PCF85063 NVMEM read The nvmem interface supports variable buffer sizes, while the regmap interface operates with fixed-size storage. If an nvmem client uses a buffer size less than 4 bytes, regmap_read will write out of bounds as it expects the buffer to point at an unsigned int. Fix this by using an intermediary unsigned int to hold the value.",
