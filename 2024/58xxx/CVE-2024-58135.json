    "description": "Mojolicious versions from 7.28 through 9.40 for Perl may generate weak HMAC session secrets. When creating a default app with the mojo generate app tool, a weak secret is written to the applications configuration file using the insecure rand() function, and used for authenticating and protecting the integrity of the applications sessions. This may allow an attacker to brute force the applications session keys.",
