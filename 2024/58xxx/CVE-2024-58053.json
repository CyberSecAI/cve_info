    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved rxrpc Fix handling of received connection abort Fix the handling of a connection abort that weve received. Though the abort is at the connection level, it needs propagating to the calls on that connection. Whilst the propagation bit is performed, the calls arent then woken up to go and process their termination, and as no further input is forthcoming, they just hang. Also add some tracing for the logging of connection aborts.",
