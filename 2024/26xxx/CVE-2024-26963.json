    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb dwc3-am62 fix module unload/reload behavior As runtime PM is enabled, the module can be runtime suspended when .remove() is called. Do a pm_runtime_get_sync() to make sure module is active before doing any register operations. Doing a pm_runtime_put_sync() should disable the refclk so no need to disable it again. Fixes the below warning at module removel. [ 39.705310] ------------[ cut here ]------------ [ 39.710004] clk1623 already disabled [ 39.713941] WARNING CPU 0 PID 921 at drivers/clk/clk.c1090 clk_core_disable+0xb0/0xb8 We called of_platform_populate() in .probe() so call the cleanup function of_platform_depopulate() in .remove(). Get rid of the now unnnecessary dwc3_ti_remove_core(). Without this, module re-load doesnt work properly.",
