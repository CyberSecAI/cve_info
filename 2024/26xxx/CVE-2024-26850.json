    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolvedmm/debug_vm_pgtable fix BUG_ON with pud advanced testArchitectures like powerpc add debug checks to ensure we find only devmapPUD pte entries. These debug checks are only done with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM. This patch marks the ptes used for PUD advanced test devmap pte entries sothat we dont hit on debug checks on architecture like ppc64 as below.WARNING CPU 2 PID 1 at arch/powerpc/mm/book3s64/radix_pgtable.c1382 radix__pud_hugepage_update+0x38/0x138....NIP [c0000000000a7004] radix__pud_hugepage_update+0x38/0x138LR [c0000000000a77a8] radix__pudp_huge_get_and_clear+0x28/0x60Call Trace[c000000004a2f950] [c000000004a2f9a0] 0xc000000004a2f9a0 (unreliable)[c000000004a2f980] [000d34c100000000] 0xd34c100000000[c000000004a2f9a0] [c00000000206ba98] pud_advanced_tests+0x118/0x334[c000000004a2fa40] [c00000000206db34] debug_vm_pgtable+0xcbc/0x1c48[c000000004a2fc10] [c00000000000fd28] do_one_initcall+0x60/0x388Also kernel BUG at arch/powerpc/mm/book3s64/pgtable.c202! ....

        "rootcause": "The debug checks in the Linux kernel for PUD (Page Upper Directory) entries during advanced testing were not correctly identifying devmap PTEs, leading to false BUG_ON errors and kernel crashes.
