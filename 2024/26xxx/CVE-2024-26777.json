    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved fbdev sis Error out if pixclock equals zero The userspace program could pass any values to the driver through ioctl() interface. If the driver doesnt check the value of pixclock, it may cause divide-by-zero error. In sisfb_check_var(), var->pixclock is used as a divisor to caculate drate before it is checked against zero. Fix this by checking it at the beginning. This is similar to CVE-2022-3061 in i740fb which was fixed by commit 15cf0b8.",
