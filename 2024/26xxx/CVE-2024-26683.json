    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi cfg80211 detect stuck ECSA element in probe resp We recently added some validation that we dont try to connect to an AP that is currently in a channel switch process, since that might want the channel to be quiet or we might not be able to connect in time to hear the switching in a beacon. This was in commit c09c4f31998b (wifi mac80211 dont connect to an AP while its in a CSA process). However, we promptly got a report that this caused new connection failures, and it turns out that the AP that we now cannot connect to is permanently advertising an extended channel switch announcement, even with quiet. The AP in question was an Asus RT-AC53, with firmware 3.0.0.4.380_10760-g21a5898. As a first step, attempt to detect that were dealing with such a situation, so mac80211 can use this later.",
