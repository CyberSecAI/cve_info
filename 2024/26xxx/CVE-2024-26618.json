    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved arm64/sme Always exit sme_alloc() early with existing storage When sme_alloc() is called with existing storage and we are not flushing we will always allocate new storage, both leaking the existing storage and corrupting the state. Fix this by separating the checks for flushing and for existing storage as we do for SVE. Callers that reallocate (eg, due to changing the vector length) should call sme_free() themselves.",
