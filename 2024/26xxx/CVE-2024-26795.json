    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved riscv Sparse-Memory/vmemmap out-of-bounds fix Offset vmemmap so that the first page of vmemmap will be mapped to the first page of physical memory in order to ensure that vmemmaps bounds will be respected during pfn_to_page()/page_to_pfn() operations. The conversion macros will produce correct SV39/48/57 addresses for every possible/valid DRAM_BASE inside the physical memory limits. v2Address Alexs comments",
