    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi mac80211 improve CSA/ECSA connection refusal As mentioned in the previous commit, we pretty quickly found that some APs have ECSA elements stuck in their probe response, so using that to not attempt to connect while CSA is happening we never connect to such an AP. Improve this situation by checking more carefully and ignoring the ECSA if cfg80211 has previously detected the ECSA element being stuck in the probe response. Additionally, allow connecting to an AP thats switching to a channel its already using, unless its using quiet mode. In this case, we may just have to adjust bandwidth later. If its actually switching channels, its better not to try to connect in the middle of that.",
