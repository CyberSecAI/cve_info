  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved comedi comedi_8255 Correct error in subdevice initialization The refactoring done in commit 5c57b1ccecc7 (comedi comedi_8255 Rework subdevice initialization functions) to the initialization of the io field of struct subdev_8255_private broke all cards using the drivers/comedi/drivers/comedi_8255.c module. Prior to 5c57b1ccecc7, __subdev_8255_init() initialized the io field in the newly allocated struct subdev_8255_private to the non-NULL callback given to the function, otherwise it used a flag parameter to select between subdev_8255_mmio and subdev_8255_io. The refactoring removed that logic and the flag, as subdev_8255_mm_init() and subdev_8255_io_init() now explicitly pass subdev_8255_mmio and subdev_8255_io respectively to __subdev_8255_init(), only __subdev_8255_init() never sets spriv->io to the supplied callback. That spriv->io is NULL leads to a later BUG BUG kernel NULL pointer dereference, address 0000000000000000 PGD 0 P4D 0 Oops 0010 [#1] SMP PTI CPU 1 PID 1210 Comm systemd-udevd Not tainted 6.7.3-x86_64 #1 Hardware name XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX RIP 00100x0 Code Unable to access opcode bytes at 0xffffffffffffffd6.
