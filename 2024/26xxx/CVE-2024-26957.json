    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved s390/zcrypt fix reference counting on zcrypt card objects Tests with hot-plugging crytpo cards on KVM guests with debug kernel build revealed an use after free for the load field of the struct zcrypt_card. The reason was an incorrect reference handling of the zcrypt card object which could lead to a free of the zcrypt card object while it was still in use. This is an example of the slab message kernel 0x00000000885a7512-0x00000000885a7513 @offset=1298.
