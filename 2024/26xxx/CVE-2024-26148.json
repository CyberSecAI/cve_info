    "description": "Querybook is a user interface for querying big data. Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybooks rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them.",
