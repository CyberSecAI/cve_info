    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Prevent potential buffer overflow in map_hw_resources Adds a check in the map_hw_resources function to prevent a potential buffer overflow. The function was accessing arrays using an index that could potentially be greater than the size of the arrays, leading to a buffer overflow. Adds a check to ensure that the index is within the bounds of the arrays. If the index is out of bounds, an error message is printed and break it will continue execution with just ignoring extra data early to prevent the buffer overflow.
