    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved dmaengine fsl-qdma fix SoC may hang on 16 byte unaligned read There is chip (ls1028a) errata The SoC may hang on 16 byte unaligned read transactions by QDMA. Unaligned read transactions initiated by QDMA may stall in the NOC (Network On-Chip), causing a deadlock condition. Stalled transactions will trigger completion timeouts in PCIe controller. Workaround Enable prefetch by setting the source descriptor prefetchable bit ( SD[PF] = 1 ). Implement this workaround.",
