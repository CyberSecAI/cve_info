    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter nf_tables mark set as dead when unbinding anonymous set with timeout While the rhashtable set gc runs asynchronously, a race allows it to collect elements from anonymous sets with timeouts while it is being released from the commit path. Mingi Cho originally reported this issue in a different path in 6.1.x with a pipapo set with low timeouts which is not possible upstream since 7395dfacfff6 (netfilter nf_tables use timestamp to check for set element timeout). Fix this by setting on the dead flag for anonymous sets to skip async gc in this case. According to 08e4c8c5919f (netfilter nf_tables mark newset as dead on transaction abort), Florian plans to accelerate abort path by releasing objects via workqueue, therefore, this sets on the dead flag for abort path too.",
