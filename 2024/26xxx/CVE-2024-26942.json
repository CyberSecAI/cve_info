    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net phy qcom at803x fix kernel panic with at8031_probe On reworking and splitting the at803x driver, in splitting function of at803x PHYs it was added a NULL dereference bug where priv is referenced before its actually allocated and then is tried to write to for the is_1000basex and is_fiber variables in the case of at8031, writing on the wrong address. Fix this by correctly setting priv local variable only after at803x_probe is called and actually allocates priv in the phydev struct.",
