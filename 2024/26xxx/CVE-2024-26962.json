    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved dm-raid456, md/raid456 fix a deadlock for dm-raid456 while io concurrent with reshape For raid456, if reshape is still in progress, then IO across reshape position will wait for reshape to make progress. However, for dm-raid, in following cases reshape will never make progress hence IO will hang 1) the array is read-only 2) MD_RECOVERY_WAIT is set 3) MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is set After commit c467e97f079f (md/raid6 use valid sector values to determine if an I/O should wait on the reshape) fix the problem that IO across reshape position doesnt wait for reshape, the dm-raid test shell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh start to hang [root@fedora ~]# cat /proc/979/stack [] wait_woken+0x7d/0x90 [] raid5_make_request+0x929/0x1d70 [raid456] [] md_handle_request+0xc2/0x3b0 [md_mod] [] raid_map+0x2c/0x50 [dm_raid] [] __map_bio+0x251/0x380 [dm_mod] [] dm_submit_bio+0x1f0/0x760 [dm_mod] [] __submit_bio+0xc2/0x1c0 [] submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x17f/0x450 [] submit_bio_noacct+0x2bc/0x780 [] submit_bio+0x70/0xc0 [] mpage_readahead+0x169/0x1f0 [] blkdev_readahead+0x18/0x30 [] read_pages+0x7c/0x3b0 [] page_cache_ra_unbounded+0x1ab/0x280 [] force_page_cache_ra+0x9e/0x130 [] page_cache_sync_ra+0x3b/0x110 [] filemap_get_pages+0x143/0xa30 [] filemap_read+0xdc/0x4b0 [] blkdev_read_iter+0x75/0x200 [] vfs_read+0x272/0x460 [] ksys_read+0x7a/0x170 [] __x64_sys_read+"
