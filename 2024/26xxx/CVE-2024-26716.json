    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb core Prevent null pointer dereference in update_port_device_state Currently, the function update_port_device_state gets the usb_hub from udev->parent by calling usb_hub_to_struct_hub. However, in case the actconfig or the maxchild is 0, the usb_hub would be NULL and upon further accessing to get port_dev would result in null pointer dereference. Fix this by introducing an if check after the usb_hub is populated.",
