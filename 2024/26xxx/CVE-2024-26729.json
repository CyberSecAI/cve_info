    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Fix potential null pointer dereference in dc_dmub_srv Fixes potential null pointer dereference warnings in the dc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() and dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up() functions. In both functions, the dc_dmub_srv variable was being dereferenced before it was checked for null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if dc_dmub_srv is null. The fix is to check if dc_dmub_srv is null before dereferencing it. Thus moving the null checks for dc_dmub_srv to the beginning of the functions to ensure that dc_dmub_srv is not null when it is dereferenced. Found by smatch & thus fixing the below drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dc_dmub_srv.c133 dc_dmub_srv_cmd_list_queue_execute() warn variable dereferenced before check dc_dmub_srv (see line 128) drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dc_dmub_srv.c1167 dc_dmub_srv_is_hw_pwr_up() warn variable dereferenced before check dc_dmub_srv (see line 1164)",
