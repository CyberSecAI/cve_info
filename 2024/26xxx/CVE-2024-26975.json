    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved powercap intel_rapl Fix a NULL pointer dereference A NULL pointer dereference is triggered when probing the MMIO RAPL driver on platforms with CPU ID not listed in intel_rapl_common CPU model list. This is because the intel_rapl_common module still probes on such platforms even if defaults_msr is not set after commit 1488ac990ac8 (powercap intel_rapl Allow probing without CPUID match). Thus the MMIO RAPL rp->priv->defaults is NULL when registering to RAPL framework. Fix the problem by adding sanity check to ensure rp->priv->rapl_defaults is always valid.",
