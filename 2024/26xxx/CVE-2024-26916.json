    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Revert drm/amd flush any delayed gfxoff on suspend entry commit ab4750332dbe (drm/amdgpu/sdma5.2 add begin/end_use ring callbacks) caused GFXOFF control to be used more heavily and the codepath that was removed from commit 0dee72639533 (drm/amd flush any delayed gfxoff on suspend entry) now can be exercised at suspend again. Users report that by using GNOME to suspend the lockscreen trigger will cause SDMA traffic and the system can deadlock. This reverts commit 0dee726395333fea833eaaf838bc80962df886c8.",
