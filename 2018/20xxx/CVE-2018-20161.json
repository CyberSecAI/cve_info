    "description": "A design flaw in the BlinkForHome (aka Blink For Home) Sync Module 2.10.4 and earlier allows attackers to disable cameras via Wi-Fi, because incident clips (triggered by the motion sensor) are not saved if the attackers traffic (such as Dot11Deauth) successfully disconnects the Sync Module from the Wi-Fi network. (Access to live video from the app also becomes unavailable.)",
