  "description": "ntpd in ntp 4.2.8p4 before 4.2.8p11 drops bad packets before updating the received timestamp, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disruption) by sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp causing the association to reset and setting the contents of the packet as the most recent timestamp.
