    "description": "Blue River Mura CMS before v7.0.7029 supports inline function calls with an [m] tag and [/m] end tag, without proper restrictions on file types or pathnames, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an [m]$.dspinclude(../pathname/executable.jpeg)[/m] approach, where executable.jpeg contains ColdFusion Markup Language code. This can be exploited in conjunction with a CKFinder feature that allows file upload.",
