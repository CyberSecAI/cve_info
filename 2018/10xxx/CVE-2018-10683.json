    "description": "An issue was discovered in WildFly 10.1.2.Final. In the case of a default installation without a security realm reference, an attacker can successfully access the server without authentication. NOTE the Security Realms documentation in the products Admin Guide indicates that without a security realm reference implies effectively unsecured. The vendor explicitly supports these unsecured configurations because they have valid use cases during development",
