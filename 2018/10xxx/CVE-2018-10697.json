    "description": "An issue was discovered on Moxa AWK-3121 1.14 devices. The Moxa AWK 3121 provides ping functionality so that an administrator can execute ICMP calls to check if the network is working correctly. However, the same functionality allows an attacker to execute commands on the device. The POST parameter srvName is susceptible to this injection. By crafting a packet that contains shell metacharacters, it is possible for an attacker to execute the attack.",
