    "description": "Under certain circumstances the fetch() API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a no-store or no-cache cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.7 and Firefox < 59.",
