  "description": "OpenWrt mishandles access control in /etc/config/rpcd and the /usr/share/rpcd/acl.d files, which allows remote authenticated users to call arbitrary methods (i.e., achieve ubus access over HTTP) that were only supposed to be accessible to a specific user, as demonstrated by the file, log, and service namespaces, potentially leading to remote Information Disclosure or Code Execution. NOTE The developer disputes this as a vulnerability, indicating that rpcd functions appropriately",
