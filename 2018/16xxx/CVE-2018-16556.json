Specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp via Ethernet interface, viaPROFIBUS, or via Multi Point Interfaces (MPI) could cause the affecteddevices to go into defect mode. Manual reboot is required to resume normaloperation.Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send speciallycrafted packets to port 102/tcp via Ethernet interface, via PROFIBUS or MultiPoint Interfaces (MPI). No user interaction and no user privileges arerequired to exploit the security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allowcausing a denial of service condition of the core functionality of the CPU,compromising the availability of the system.",
