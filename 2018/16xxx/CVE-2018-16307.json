    "description": "An Out-of-band resource load issue was discovered on Xiaomi MIWiFi Xiaomi_55DD Version 2.8.50 devices. It is possible to induce the application to retrieve the contents of an arbitrary external URL and return those contents in its own response. If a domain name (containing a random string) is used in the HTTP Host header, the application performs an HTTP request to the specified domain. The response from that request is then included in the applications own response.",
