Sending of specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp via Ethernet interfacevia PROFIBUS or Multi Point Interfaces (MPI) could cause a denial of servicecondition on affected devices. Flashing with a firmware image may be requiredto recover the CPU.Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have network access to port102/tcp via Ethernet interface or to be able to send messages via PROFIBUS orMulti Point Interfaces (MPI) to the device. No user interaction is required.If no access protection is configured, no privileges are required to exploitthe security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing adenial of service condition of the core functionality of the CPU,compromising the availability of the system.",
