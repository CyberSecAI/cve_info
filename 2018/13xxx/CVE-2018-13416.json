    "description": "In Universal Media Server (UMS) 7.1.0, the XML parsing engine for SSDP/UPnP functionality is vulnerable to an XML External Entity Processing (XXE) attack. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can use this vulnerability to (1) Access arbitrary files from the filesystem with the same permission as the user account running UMS, (2) Initiate SMB connections to capture a NetNTLM challenge/response and crack to cleartext password, or (3) Initiate SMB connections to relay a NetNTLM challenge/response and achieve Remote Command Execution in Windows domains.",
