    "description": "An XSS issue was discovered in Advanced Electron Forum (AEF) v1.0.9. A persistent XSS vulnerability is located in the `FTP Link` element of the `Private Message` module. The editor of the private message module allows inserting links without sanitizing the content. This allows remote attackers to inject malicious script code payloads as a private message (aka pmbody). The injection point is the editor ftp link element and the execution point occurs in the message body context on arrival. The request method to inject is POST with restricted user privileges.",
