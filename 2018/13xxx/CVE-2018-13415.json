Remote, unauthenticated attackers can use this vulnerability to (1) Access arbitrary files from the filesystem with the same permission as the user account running Plex, (2) Initiate SMB connections to capture a NetNTLM challenge/response and crack to cleartext password, or (3) Initiate SMB connections to relay a NetNTLM challenge/response and achieve Remote Command Execution in Windows domains.",
