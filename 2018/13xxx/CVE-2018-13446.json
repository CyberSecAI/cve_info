The Passcode feature allows authentication bypass via runtime manipulation that forces a certain methods return value to true. In other words, an attacker could authenticate with an arbitrary passcode. NOTE the vendor indicates that this is not an attack of interest within the context of their threat model, which excludes Android devices on which rooting has occurred",
