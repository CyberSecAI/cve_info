    "description": "GNOME Keyring through 3.28.2 allows local users to retrieve login credentials via a Secret Service API call and the D-Bus interface if the keyring is unlocked, a similar issue to CVE-2008-7320. One perspective is that this occurs because available D-Bus protection mechanisms (involving the busconfig and policy XML elements) are not used. NOTE the vendor disputes this because, according to the security model, untrusted applications must not be allowed to access the users session bus socket.",
