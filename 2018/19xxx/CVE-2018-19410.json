A remote unauthenticated user can craft an HTTP request and override attributes of the include directive in /public/login.htm and perform a Local File Inclusion attack, by including /api/addusers and executing it. By providing the id and users parameters, an unauthenticated attacker can create a user with read-write privileges (including administrator).",
