    "description": "A vulnerability in the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) bitstream processing of the Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming RTP bitstreams. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted RTP bitstream to an affected Cisco Meeting Server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deny audio and video services by causing media process crashes resulting in a DoS condition on the affected product. This vulnerability affects Cisco Meeting Server deployments that are running Cisco Meeting Server Software Releases 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. Cisco Bug IDs CSCve79693, CSCvf91393, CSCvg64656, CSCvh30725, CSCvi86363.",
