    "description": "A vulnerability in the file descriptor handling of Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Expressway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to exhaustion of file descriptors while processing a high volume of traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a high number of concurrent TCP connections to the vulnerable system. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a restart in a specific process, resulting in a temporary interruption of service. Cisco Bug IDs CSCvh77056, CSCvh77058, CSCvh95264.",
