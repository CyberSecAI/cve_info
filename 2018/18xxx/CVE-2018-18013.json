    "description": "* Xen Mobile through 10.8.0 includes a service listening on port 5001 within its firewall that accepts unauthenticated input. If this service is supplied with raw serialised Java objects, it deserialises them back into Java objects in memory, giving rise to a remote code execution vulnerability. NOTE the vendor disputes that this is a vulnerability, stating it is already mitigated by the internal firewall that limits access to configuration services to localhost.",
