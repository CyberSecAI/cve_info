    "description": "Multiple exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the credentials handler of video-cores HTTP server of Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 devices with firmware version 0.20.17. The video-core process incorrectly extracts fields from a user-controlled JSON payload, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. A strncpy overflows the destination buffer, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long region value in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
