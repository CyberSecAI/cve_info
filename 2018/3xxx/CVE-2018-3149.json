    "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent JNDI). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE 6u201, 7u191, 8u182 and 11 Java SE Embedded 8u181 JRockit R28.3.19. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g. code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g. through a web service which supplies data to the APIs.
