    "description": "CVE-2018-8025 describes an issue in Apache HBase that affects the optional Thrift 1 API server when running over HTTP. There is a race-condition which could lead to authenticated sessions being incorrectly applied to users, e.g. one authenticated user would be considered a different user or an unauthenticated user would be treated as an authenticated user. https//issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-20664 implements a fix for this issue. It has been fixed in versions 1.2.6.1, 1.3.2.1, 1.4.5, 2.0.1.",
