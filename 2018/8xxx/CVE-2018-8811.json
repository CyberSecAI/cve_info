    "description": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in system/workplace/admin/accounts/user_role.jsp in OpenCMS 10.5.3 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrative users for requests that perform privilege escalation. Note It is argued that OpenCMS allows only registered users to upload different kind of content artifacts (SVG, .doc, .docx). The uploaded content is stored in the CMS content repository as is. In case of scripts inside an SVG, this may or may not be malicious, there is no way of knowing if the uploaded SVG contains the script for a reason. To exploit the issue, a user must have an account in the CMS as a content manager",
