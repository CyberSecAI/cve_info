    "description": "In Apache OFBiz 16.11.01 to 16.11.04, the OFBiz HTTP engine (org.apache.ofbiz.service.engine.HttpEngine.java) handles requests for HTTP services via the /webtools/control/httpService endpoint. Both POST and GET requests to the httpService endpoint may contain three parameters serviceName, serviceMode, and serviceContext. The exploitation occurs by having DOCTYPEs pointing to external references that trigger a payload that returns secret information from the host.",
