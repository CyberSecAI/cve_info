    "description": "During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access. *Note this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 63, Firefox ESR < 60.3, and Thunderbird < 60.3.",
