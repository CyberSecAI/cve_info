  "description": "A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write. *Note 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 63, Firefox ESR < 60.3, and Thunderbird < 60.3.",
