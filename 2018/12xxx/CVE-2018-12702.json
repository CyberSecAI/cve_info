    "description": "The approveAndCallcode function of a smart contract implementation for Globalvillage ecosystem (GVE), an Ethereum ERC20 token, allows attackers to steal assets (e.g., transfer the contracts balances into their account) because the callcode (i.e., _spender.call(_extraData)) is not verified, aka the evilReflex issue. NOTE a PeckShield disclosure states some researchers have independently discussed the mechanism of such vulnerability.",
