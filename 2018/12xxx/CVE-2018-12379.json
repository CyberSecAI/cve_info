    "description": "When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 62, Firefox ESR < 60.2, and Thunderbird < 60.2.1.",
