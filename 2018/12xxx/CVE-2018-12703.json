    "description": "The approveAndCallcode function of a smart contract implementation for Block 18 (18T), an tradable Ethereum ERC20 token, allows attackers to steal assets (e.g., transfer the contracts balances into their account) because the callcode (i.e., _spender.call(_extraData)) is not verified, aka the evilReflex issue. NOTE a PeckShield disclosure states some researchers have independently discussed the mechanism of such vulnerability.",
