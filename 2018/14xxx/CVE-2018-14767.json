    "description": "In Kamailio before 5.0.7 and 5.1.x before 5.1.4, a crafted SIP message with a double To header and an empty To tag causes a segmentation fault and crash. The reason is missing input validation in the build_res_buf_from_sip_req core function. This could result in denial of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.",
