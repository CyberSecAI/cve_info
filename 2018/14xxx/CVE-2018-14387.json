    "description": "An issue was discovered in WonderCMS before 2.5.2. An attacker can create a new session on a web application and record the associated session identifier. The attacker then causes the victim to authenticate against the server using the same session identifier. The attacker can access the users account through the active session. The Session Fixation attack fixes a session on the victims browser, so the attack starts before the user logs in.",
