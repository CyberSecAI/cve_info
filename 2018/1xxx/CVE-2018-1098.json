    "description": "A cross-site request forgery flaw was found in etcd 3.3.1 and earlier. An attacker can set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd server and modify a key. Adding a key is done with PUT so it is theoretically safe (cant PUT from an HTML form or such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an attacker can send.",
