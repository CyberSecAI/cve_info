    "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1 Java SE Embedded 8u151 JRockit R28.3.16. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note This vulnerability applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service.
