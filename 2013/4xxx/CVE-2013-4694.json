    "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in gen_jumpex.dll in Winamp before 5.64 Build 3418 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a package with a long Skin directory name. NOTE a second buffer overflow involving a long GUI Search field to ml_local.dll was also reported. However, since it is only exploitable by the user of the application, this issue would not cross privilege boundaries unless Winamp is running under a highly restricted environment such as a kiosk.",
