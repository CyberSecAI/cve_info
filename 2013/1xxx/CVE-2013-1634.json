    "description": "A denial of service vulnerability exists in some motherboard implementations of Intel e1000e/82574L network controller devices through 2013-02-06 where the device can be brought into a non-processing state when parsing 32 hex, 33 hex, or 34 hex byte values at the 0x47f offset. NOTE A followup statement from Intel suggests that the root cause of this issue was an incorrectly configured EEPROM image.",
