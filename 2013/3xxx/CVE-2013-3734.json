    "description": "The Embedded Jopr component in JBoss Application Server includes the cleartext datasource password in unspecified HTML responses, which might allow (1) man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging failure to use SSL or (2) attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading the HTML source code. NOTE the vendor says that this does not cross a trust boundary and that it is recommended best-practice that SSL is configured for the administrative console",
