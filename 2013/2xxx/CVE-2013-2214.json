    "description": "status.cgi in Nagios 4.0 before 4.0 beta4 and 3.x before 3.5.1 does not properly restrict access to certain users that are a contact for a service, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information about hostnames via the servicegroup (1) overview, (2) summary, or (3) grid style in status.cgi. NOTE this behavior is by design in most 3.x versions, but the upstream vendor decided to change it for Nagios 4 and 3.5.1.",
