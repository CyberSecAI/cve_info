  "description": "Rockwell Automation RSLinx Enterprise Software (LogReceiver.exe) CPR9, CPR9-SR1, CPR9-SR2, CPR9-SR3, CPR9-SR4, CPR9-SR5, CPR9-SR5.1, and CPR9-SR6 does not handle input correctly and results in a logic error if it calculates an incorrect value for the End of Current Record field. By sending a datagram to the service over Port 4444/UDP with the Record Data Size field modified to a specifically oversized value, the service will calculate an undersized value for the Total Record Size. Then the service will calculate an incorrect value for the End of Current Record field causing access violations that lead to a service crash. The service can be recovered with a manual reboot.
