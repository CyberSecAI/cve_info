    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 6u65 and 7u45, Java SE Embedded 7u45, and OpenJDK 7 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Security. NOTE the previous information is from the January 2014 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that the Security component does not properly handle null XML namespace (xmlns) attributes during XML document canonicalization, which allows attackers to escape the sandbox.",
