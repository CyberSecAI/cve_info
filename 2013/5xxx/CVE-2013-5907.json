    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 5.0u55, 6u65, and 7u45 JRockit R27.7.7 and R28.2.9 Java SE Embedded 7u45 and OpenJDK 7 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to 2D. NOTE the previous information is from the January 2014 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that the issue is due to incorrect input validation in LookupProcessor.cpp in the ICU Layout Engine, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted font file.",
